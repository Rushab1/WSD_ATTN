The

has
to

ADD
SUTCLIFFE
:
The
Cubs
'
veteran
pitcher
,
who
underwent
shoulder
surgery
last
year
,
found
it
HARD
to
suppress
his
emotion
after
Thursday
'
s
comeback
victory
.

They
were
better
live
than
on
record
,
because
guitarist
Mick
Jones
gave
the
songs
a
HARDER
edge
.

``
And
because
quarterbacks
are
so
HARD
to
find
,
he
may
end
up
being
the
first
player
drafted
.
'
'

When
I
ask
people
nearby
to
keep
their
radios
off
,
they
act
like
I
am
crazy
and
give
me
a
HARD
time
.

Beverly
Hayon
,
spokeswoman
for
Kaiser
Permanente
Medical
Care
Program
,
said
``
It
'
s
HARD
to
see
how
(
this
)
is
going
to
stop
the
AIDS
epidemic
.

And
the
parts
would
be
HARD
to
trace
on
the
world
market
,
he
added
:
``
I
can
'
t
think
of
any
individual
,
single
items
that
if
they
import
that
,
watch

em

'
'

But
it
was
HARD
to
watch
as
movers
recently
emptied
the
old
home
of
its
many
antiques
,
including
the
25
floor-to-ceiling
clocks
Albert
has
refurbished
over
the
years
.

Tilbury
said
he
has
heard
of
some
victims
bidding
on
homes
,
but
that
has
been
primarily
in
the
hills
for
HARD
to-find
three-
and
four-bedroom
houses
.

Do
n
'
t
you
feel
kind
of
sorry
for
the
poor
working
girl
who
,
dog-tired
after
a
HARD
night
of
patrolling
her
dismal
beat
,
has
to
go
a
half-mile
out
of
her
way
to
get
home
?

The
HARDEST
part
of
calculating
the
costs
of
fighting
a
war
is
that
it
requires
making
adjustments
for
the
costs
of
not
fighting
.

``
I
learn

excellent
work

pompously

a
HARD
time
on

And
it
is
HARD
to
know
what
his

After

,
it

HARD
to
get
giddy
over
any
one
game
when
you

35-46

be
HARD
to
find

Seems
even
HARDER
to
believe
it

still
around
to
celebrate
anything
.

If
only
the
big
cheese
had
strolled
through
the
airport
as
I
was
bedding
down
on
a
HARD
plastic
chair
for
half
a
night
,
I
could
have
told

a
thing

``
Mentally
he

SO
MANY
things
were
going
on
the
night
Anita
Hill

out
of
Ivory
Tower
seclusion
last
weekend
,
it
was
HARD
to
sort
them
all
out

About
$1

from

MARIEL
HEMINGWAY
;
(
box
)
Papa
was
a
HARD
act
to
follow
;
Her
appearance
at
age
17
in
Woody
Allen
'
s
Manhattan
made
her
a
star
,
but
none
of
her
subsequent
films
was

so
Hemingway
took
a
leave
from

if

It

as
to
quality
of

The
weekly

partly
counterbalanced
by
500
arrivals

West
Germany

the
HARD
truth

says
Crossman
,
is
that
``The
closing
off

Berlin

interference
from
the
West

with
the

German

Producers
of
action
shows
,
like
Cannell
,
are
willing
to
make
them
at
a
bargain
price
to
help
CBS
open
up
a
new
market
for
one-hour
action
shows
,
which
have
become
HARD
to
sell
in
the
rerun
market
.

seven

``
It

s
HARD
for
a
lot
of
people
to

HARDER
economic
times
,
we
see
more
needs
developing
in
our
communities

urgency
to
look
for
help
beyond
government
,
beyond
the
churches
and
the
non-profit
sector
.

``
It
'
s
possible
that
so
few
companies
had
a
HARD
time
complying
with
the
laws
because
many
had
already
developed
policies
and
practices
that
were
not
far
out
of

with
what
these
parent-leave
laws
required
