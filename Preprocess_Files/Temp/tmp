The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious   causes   of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott + Co. , committee chairman .
 The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying   causes   for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Other recommendations made by the committee are :
 Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the   causes   and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .
 No . This is a common symptom and the   cause   usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand . The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .
 writes : Does a brace help in sciatica ? A back brace might help , depending upon the   cause   of sciatica . writes : Does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ?
 `` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin . And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the   cause   of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race '' . Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' .

 However , in all of Prokofieff 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the   cause   of experimentation per se . In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .
 The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the   cause   and effect relationship between these two primary forces . Oersted 's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .
 Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia quickstep '' . A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the   cause   and consequence of diarrhoea : `` I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days . I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [ on ] my stomack and turn loose on me '' .
 He says he do n't want no trouble '' . But Torrio and Capone had graver   cause   to hate and distrust the Irishman . For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O ' Banion 's impudent double-crossing .
 I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main   cause   of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .
 In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American   cause   . Only in Europe have our lines remained firm - and there only on the surface .
 Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of   cause   in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .
 There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears . Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable   cause   , and these they attribute to the will of God '' . Perhaps things were even worse then .
 We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles . We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social   cause   and effect . Small wonder , then , that we fear .
 He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading . What he really wants is to find `` a sacred   cause   '' to which he can honestly devote himself . This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden .
 This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden . His   cause   was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . He did not , however , find himself at once .
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make or cause to be made a study covering - the   causes   of injuries and health hazards in metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) ; the relative effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory reporting of accident statistics ;
 Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . The   causes   of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service .

 Extensions are not granted as a matter of course , and the reasons for your request must be substantial . If you are unable to sign the request , because of illness or other good   cause   , another person who stands in close personal or business relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf , stating the reason why you are unable to sign . You should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refused , your return may still be on time .
 Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings . Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the   cause   of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity . In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination .
 No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy . The Providence Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good   cause   would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . The Woonsocket Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or James Buchanan '' .
 Therefore , Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great   cause   of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor . Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .
 `` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them . In the next few days they had   cause   to rejoice . It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won .
 Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went . Not that she complained , or had any   cause   to . Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran around together .
 Motive . Here , too , the   cause   to hate lay well back in the years . But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode .

 Scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities . No other   cause   of death apparent . Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects .
 And there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs . In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little   cause   to complain . The place had been cheap - just the little he had left after Amelia 's burial - and it would serve its purpose .
 The Champs Elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of France 's beat-up beatnik jeunes filles .  Cause   of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre Bravado , a Bogartian figure , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico de Mille Rossilini 's endlessly provocative film , A Sour Sponge . Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' !
 Mr. Rivasseau -LRB- France -RRB- -LRB- spoke in French -RRB- : I have the honour to introduce draft resolution A/C.1/60/L.39 , entitled âPreventing the risk of radiological terrorismâ , on behalf of France and the other sponsors . The question of terrorism has become a major   cause   for concern within the multilateral disarmament community . In that connection , I would like to draw attention to our new draft resolution which is being submitted for the first time for adoption by the First Committee this year , concerning preventing the risk of radiological terrorism .
 The Act to Combat Poverty and Social Exclusion was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly in 2002 . The purpose of this Act is to encourage the government and all of Quebec society to plan and implement measures to combat poverty , eliminate the   causes   of poverty , reduce its effects on individuals and families , counter social exclusion and aim for a QuÃ©bec without poverty . This law led to the national strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion , which has as its primary objective to progressively reduce poverty in QuÃ©bec to the level of industrialized nations with the least amount of poverty by 2013 .
 Human rights offenders apprehended by the impartial forces in the zone of confidence are , as a rule , released without further action by the authorities . Serious violations of the fundamental human rights of Ivorian citizens are both a   cause   and a consequence of the political and military crisis in CÃ´te d'Ivoire since September 2002 . Sustained efforts by the international community to achieve lasting peace and promote national reconciliation will prove incomplete unless decisive action is taken to end the culture of impunity for serious human rights violations .
 Basin States shall cooperate according to the procedures in Chapter XI to set drawdown rates in order to assure the equitable utilization of the waters of an aquifer referred in paragraph 1 , having due regard for the obligation not to cause significant harm to other basin States and to the obligation to protect the aquifer . Basin States sharing an aquifer referred to in paragraph 1 shall refrain from and prevent acts or omissions within their territory that   cause   significant harm to another basin State , having due regard to the right of each basin State to make equitable and reasonable use of the waters . Article 8 : General obligation to cooperate
 There are no precise data on , for example , the increase of violence resulting from mental disorders , such as the rate of increase of suicides and murders . Migration , unemployment , change of family conditions , increase of violence and other high-risk factors are   causes   of almost all mental disorders and disorders of behaviour that result in suicides . The rate of suicide is 3.8 per 100 , 000 -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and 32 per 100 , 000 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- .

 But , then , what about the major terrorist crimes that were , regrettably , carried out on 11 September 2001 in New York , on 11 March 2005 in Madrid , and on 7 July 2005 in London â as well as the many other terrorist acts that have been carried out â despite the fact that all those countries have very strong and highly effective intelligence and security authorities ? Again , there is a hypothesis in paragraph 124 , that âThere is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials and could not have been further organized without the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security services.â -LRB- Ibid. , para . However , that is a charge that could be levelled against the security service of any country in the world on whose territory a terrorist crime or act has taken place .
 The assassination of Mr. Hariri , occurring only months before planned parliamentary elections , raised fears that Lebanon would return to its violent past . In condemning the attack , the Security Council requested that I report to it urgently on its   causes   , circumstances and consequences . Within days I dispatched a mission of inquiry , which concluded that an international commission should independently investigate the crime .
 In its first report , the Team recommended adding to the Consolidated List the names of individuals and groups found to be supplying Al-Qaida-associated terrorists with material or expertise to construct weapons designed to cause mass casualties . This requires no revision to the arms embargo and as the supply of arms to listed terrorists is more likely to come from non-State actors than from States themselves , the Team continues to recommend that the Council remind States of their obligation to ensure that their nationals do not breach the arms embargo , and encourage States to prosecute and to submit for inclusion on the List those of their nationals or others whom they have reasonable   cause   to suspect of doing so . C. Man-portable air defence systems
 The Secretary-General reports that â u p to 144 million people in Africa currently live in areas at risk of epidemic malariaâ -LRB- A/60/208 , para . Epidemic malaria is the   cause   of up to 12 million malaria episodes and between 155 , 000 and 310 , 000 deaths per year among people of all ages in Africa alone . Malaria is , however , a disease that is preventable , treatable and curable .
 Recommendations for action This chapter will highlight the causes and risk factors associated with violence against women and the links between particular   causes   and forms of violence against women . The role of discrimination against women as cause and perpetuating feature of violence against women will be highlighted .
 It is a threat that has grown more urgent in the last five years . Transnational networks of terrorist groups have global reach and make common   cause   to pose a universal threat . Such groups profess a desire to acquire nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and to inflict mass casualties .
 Persons detained on grounds of having engaged in a terrorist act may not be transferred by one State to another State except under legally recognized extradition , expulsion or deportation procedures that fully conform with all international human rights and humanitarian rules . Transfers of persons detained on grounds of having engaged in a terrorist act should not be carried out when there is reasonable   cause   to believe that a request for transfer is motivated by prejudice , discrimination or other impermissible bias or when there is any reason to believe that the person for whom the transfer is sought would not have a fair trial in conformity with all rules of international law relating to the administration of justice , or would be subjected to conditions of detention that do not fully meet all international standards . In particular , States sending a person should affirm that there are no unjustifiable exceptions , limitations or derogations in place in the receiving State .
 All rules relating to privacy and property rights must be in strict conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law norms . States must not encroach , either electronically or by any other means , on correspondence or other private communications without warrants issued with sufficient   cause   . Property may not be seized as part of counter-terrorism measures without warrants issued on the basis of sufficient cause .
 States must not encroach , either electronically or by any other means , on correspondence or other private communications without warrants issued with sufficient cause . Property may not be seized as part of counter-terrorism measures without warrants issued on the basis of sufficient   cause   . All persons or groups whose property has been seized or whose assets have been frozen have the right to challenge this through full and fair legal proceedings , which , owing to the gravity of seizing property or freezing assets in democratic societies and the principle of the presumption of innocence , must be compulsory .
 Property rights are guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , article 17 . Regional human rights declarations and conventions must also be consulted in determining what is sufficient   cause   . The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that some âsecret surveillanceâ might be allowed during genuine emergency situations , but this is not unlimited .
 Recognizing that acts of deportation or forcible transfer of populations which , inter alia , lead to or result from mass exoduses and displacements are included as crimes against humanity in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court -LRB- A/CONF.183/9 -RRB- , and recognizing also the importance of ending impunity for perpetrators of such crimes , Recognizing also that the human rights machinery of the United Nations , including the mechanisms of the Commission and the human rights treaty bodies , has important capabilities for addressing human rights violations that   cause   movements of refugees and displaced persons or prevent durable solutions to their plight , Welcoming the Agenda for Protection , emanating from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ' Global Consultations on International Protection , which was endorsed by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner 's Programme and welcomed by the General Assembly , and noting in this context the elements that relate to refugees in mass influx situations , including those relating to the problem of insecurity in refugee camps and the importance of refugee registration ,
 In presenting his initial proposals for our outcome document , last March , Secretary-General Kofi Annan aptly reminded that us that the cause of larger freedom can only be advanced if nations work together . We have before us at this meeting a package of proposals which address the   cause   of larger freedom in all its dimensions â those relating to development , to security and to human rights . We also have before us a set of proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and responsiveness of the United Nations as an institutional structure .
 As underscored on various other occasions , Japan would like to urge Member States to join and implement the 12 counter-terrorism-related international conventions and protocols as a matter of urgency and to sign the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in its early stage . At the same time , it is essential for the international community to clearly state that the targeting and deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants can not be justified or legitimized by any   cause   or grievance , and to cooperate in concluding the negotiation of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism by June 2006 . Although it takes time and is a difficult task to prepare domestic legislation and measures to implement resolutions 1267 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , 1373 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- and 1540 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and other relevant resolutions , the sound way to counter terrorism is to continue to make steady progress in such preparations .
 Let me make one more point on peace and security , because it strongly represents a point in which we deeply believe . On the subject of terrorism , the Secretary-General cautions that no   cause   or belief justifies terror and indiscriminate violence against civilians . Calling for international cooperation to defeat terrorism , he stresses that this menace âis not the product of any particular religion or ideology , nor is it directed only at certain countries or peopleâ -LRB- A/60/1 , para .
 The representative of an environmental non-governmental organization called for urgent action on both ozone depletion and climate change . While actions taken under the Montreal Protocol had so far led to a reduction in greenhouse gases , this was little   cause   for rejoicing , as much more could have been achieved if the Multilateral Fund had not funded so many HCFC and HFC alternatives to CFCs . HFC emissions could reach as much as 20-25 per cent of CO2 emissions over the period 2015-2100 .
 In this context , we would like to emphasize a number of points . First , a far-reaching prevention strategy to tackle the underlying   causes   of conflict would make it possible to provide for the protection of civilians in the long term . Such a strategy would be based on the promotion of sustainable development , poverty eradication , national reconciliation , good governance , the promotion of a culture of peace and tolerance , the rule of law and the observance of human rights .
 This Act concerns forms of sexual harassment and abuse that are criminal offences . Teachers , support teachers and principals have a reporting duty if they suspect sexual violence and abuse , as does the competent authority as soon as there is reasonable   cause   for suspicion . The Project for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment -LRB- PPSI -RRB- is concerned with information provision .
 -LRB- i.e. military necessity , distinction , discrimination , proportionality , precautions taken before and during an attack , superfluous injury/unnecessary suffering , environmental protection , any others ? When attempting to prevent the appearance of explosive remnants of war -LRB- ERW -RRB- , an especially important principle is âthe prohibition on the use of weapons , ammunition -LRB- projectiles -RRB- and methods and material of warfare that   cause   superfluous injury or unnecessary sufferingâ . Both from the point of view of military needs and the civilian population returning to the area after an operation , the ammunition used should be dependable , reliable and work specifically according to its purpose at the moment it is used .
 Ten are member countries of the European Union , and these agreements are no longer in force having been superseded by European Union regulations . 5.4 According to the author , the fact that Spanish social security legislation does not establish the same rules for the calculation of the pension that Spain must pay to all those who leave the country and cease to contribute to the Spanish social security scheme is the   cause   of the discrimination of which he is victim . The legislation does not cover the situation of emigrants .
 The ophthalmologist who operated on her , however , concluded in his report that an ocular contusion with subsequent tearing might well have given rise to a detached retina a month after the accident . 2.5 The author filed an application for reconsideration of the judgement , requesting that the evidence be properly assessed , taking into account that the expert evidence proposed by the defendant had been heard in court , while the testimony of the expert proposed by the author had been disallowed without   cause   . The High Court dismissed the application on 25 September 1996 .
 However , he failed a few subjects , and complained about the grades to various authorities , and requested to have access to his exam papers . By letter of 6 March 2000 , the author was informed that he had been excluded from the course of Physiotherapy for a period of two years , for failure to show good   cause   why he should be allowed to re-enrol in the course . 2.3 On 4 September 2000 , the author filed a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission claiming that the University , in excluding him , had discriminated against him on the grounds of race and disability .
 The declaration specifies : âThe Government of Egypt makes this Declaration , which re-affirms the Convention of 1988 , as an expression of their desire and determination to enable the Suez Canal to be an efficient and adequate waterway linking the nations of the world and serving the   cause   of peace and prosperity . âThis Declaration , with the obligations therein , constitutes an international instrument and will be deposited and registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations.â
 Terrorism is an attack on democracy and human rights . No   cause   justifies the targeting of civilians and non-combatants through intimidation and deadly acts of violence . We firmly reject any ideology that guides the actions of terrorists .
 The Security Council underlined that such a terrorist act should jeopardize neither the holding of the upcoming parliamentary elections under transparent , free and democratic conditions nor the full implementation of all relevant resolutions concerning the restoration of the territorial integrity , full sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon . The Security Council requested the Secretary-General to follow closely the situation in Lebanon and to report urgently on the circumstances ,   causes   and consequences of this terrorist act . On 18 February , the Secretary-General informed the members of the Security Council about his decision to send a team to Beirut led by Peter FitzGerald -LRB- Ireland -RRB- to examine available evidence and conduct investigations regarding the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri .
 The secretariat said that overall , UNICEF work in child protection was improving , indicators had been developed and more work was being done to support children with disability . Concluding the discussion , the Executive Director said there was a need for more integrated approaches and strengthened partnerships , which would advance the   cause   of children and the Millennium Development Goals . -LRB- See annex , decision 2005/10 for the decision adopted by the Executive Board .
 Finally , we hope to cooperate with the developed countries in implementing the agreements reached in the Millennium Declaration Goals , particularly the Millennium Development Goals , as they pertain to meeting Africa 's needs at all levels . Egypt wishes to underline its endorsement of the conclusions of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict in Africa -LRB- A/60/182 -RRB- . The report presents a unique vision of the achievements , challenges and threats in the area of peace and security on the African continent , as well as regional and international initiatives taken in that regard .
 We welcome the report 's thorough description of priorities on the African continent , in particular the continuing negative impact of the illegal exploitation of natural resources in conflict areas . Egypt calls on the Security Council to give particular attention to that problem when dealing with the   causes   of armed conflicts in Africa , because it is well known that the illegal exploitation of natural resources in conflict areas is a main cause of the persistence of armed conflicts . Furthermore , the problem is linked to the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons .

 We hope that these developments will provide the basis for an environment conducive to economic growth and development . An important factor in addressing the   causes   of conflict and contributing to durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , cited by the Secretary-General 's report , is the commitment of the international community , including United Nations organizations , to allocate increased financial , human and technical resources . For its part , India has participated in almost every peacekeeping mission in Africa and has over 5 , 000 peacekeepers now serving in Africa .
 With regard to the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction so often addressed by certain countries , it is none other than the threat of existing nuclear weapons that has caused this proliferation . Therefore , if we are to achieve non-proliferation , our first and most important task must be to completely destroy nuclear weapons , the   cause   of global proliferation , as soon as possible . Nuclear disarmament is the best way to stop proliferation .
 Reinstatement was automatic according to the legal opinion of the United Nations . If status was to be withdrawn , a new complaint was to be filed , giving new   causes   for action . If no new information was provided , this action was called âdouble jeopardyâ in his country .
 On 5 July 2004 , the Appeals Chamber partially granted appeals by both appellants against the Trial Chamber 's âDecision on the Defence Urgent Motion to Declare Parts of the Evidence of Witnesses RV and QBZ Inadmissibleâ . The Appeals Chamber considered lead counsel 's month-long illness as good   cause   for extension of time pursuant to rule 116 -LRB- A -RRB- . It dismissed the appeal under rule 89 -LRB- C -RRB- that the Trial Chamber should not have allowed the prosecution to adduce evidence on allegations which were not clearly pleaded in the indictment and stated that although on the basis of the indictment it was not possible to convict Nyiramasuhuko in respect of her presence at the installation of Ndayambaje , evidence of that meeting could be admitted to the extent that it might be relevant to the proof of any allegation pleaded in the indictment .

On 27 September 2004 , the Appeals Chamber dismissed Nyiramasuhuko 's request for reconsideration of the appeal decision on the ground that the reason advanced by the appellant â that certification had been granted before the Appeals Chamber 's decision of 5 July 2004 and that she had presented arguments on the admissibility of the evidence of witnesses â did not constitute good   cause   within the meaning of rule 116 -LRB- A -RRB- .7 On 4 October 2004 , the Appeals Chamber dismissed Nyiramasuhuko 's appeal concerning a decision to admit as evidence a diary allegedly belonging to her .
 Mr. Southcott -LRB- Australia -RRB- : Last year when Australia spoke under this agenda item , we had some grave concerns about the situation in the Middle East , and our prognosis was bleak . One year later , we have seen some significant changes , and , while much remains that is of concern , we nevertheless feel there is   cause   for at least guarded optimism . After a long period of stagnation on negotiations and a vicious spiral of violence , some heartening steps have been made on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process â including Israel 's remarkable withdrawal from Gaza .
 Rule 10 In accordance with article 72 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , if a member of the Committee dies or resigns or declares for any other   cause   that he or she can no longer perform his or her duties as a member of the Committee , the Secretary-General shall immediately request the State party that nominated the expert to appoint within two months another expert from among its own nationals for the remaining part of the term . The new appointment is subject to the approval of the Committee .
 According to Section 3 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act B.E. 2542 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and Ministerial Regulation No. 1 issued under the Anti-Money Laundering Act , the definition of `` financial institutions '' includes banks , finance companies , securities companies , credit fonciers , insurance and assurance companies , savings cooperatives , securitization companies , money changers and asset management companies . According to Section 16 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act , lawyers , accountants and notaries have the legal obligation to report suspicious transactions to the Anti-Money Laundering Office -LRB- AMLO -RRB- if -LRB- a -RRB- they are engaged in a business of operating or advising to engage in investment transactions or the movement of capital , and -LRB- b -RRB- where there is probable   cause   to believe that such transactions are linked to an asset resulting from a commission of terrorist offenses or is a suspicious transaction . As regards the reporting obligation , the CTC has noted that no convictions have been secured in Thailand for failing to report suspicious transactions and that a maximum fine of 300 , 000 Baht may be imposed .
 However , the names of those who commit such transactions shall be put in the watch-list for concerned agencies . Suspicious cases where there is   cause   to believe they should be frozen are currently under investigation . So far , there has not been any evidence to connect those transactions to the commission of terrorist acts .
 If there is more than one agency involved , do these agencies share information and do they coordinate their activities ? The Customs Department is responsible only for cargo inspection unless there is   cause   to believe that a person is carrying prohibited goods . The Immigration Service Department is responsible for the supervision of people travelling into and out of Thailand .
 In addition , the separation wall was being built . Unfolding events gave no   cause   for optimism ; there could be no hope that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East could be concluded in the near future . His delegation thus viewed the Agency 's financial problems with deep concern , since they were preventing it from meeting the growing needs of the Palestinian refugees .
 Women 's participation in development The preamble of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women9 stressed that the full and complete development of a country , the welfare of the world and the   cause   of peace required the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields . Article 7 required States parties to ensure that women had the right to participate in political and public life , including in elections , in government policy formulation and in non-governmental organizations .
 If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years ' estimates are missing , a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method . If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency , and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the   cause   of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance -LRB- such as inappropriate activity data , emission factors or methods -RRB- , expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1 . Table 1. Basic adjustment methods to obtain an emission/removal estimate -LRB- in order of priority -RRB-
 It must avoid double standards and refrain from linking terrorism with any civilization , ethnic group or religion . The manifestations and   causes   of terrorism must be tackled at the same time . China believed that the United Nations should play a leading role in coordinating the fight against international terrorism , and that the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security should find further expression in the fight against terrorism .
 Mr. Zarkashi -LRB- Malaysia -RRB- said that , despite â or perhaps because of â the concerted action launched against international terrorism since the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the number of terrorist incidents around the world had increased , showing that terrorists could strike at any time and place of their choosing . Terrorists increasingly aimed their attacks at âsoftâ targets rather than Governments or military targets , and continued in their attempts to attribute a just   cause   to their acts of violence . They would not succeed in their efforts to demoralize the countries and people they attacked .
 Unilateral divorce by the husband is where a woman is under constant threat of divorce without knowing when or why it may occur . If the husband divorces his wife and it is clear to the cadi that the husband has acted arbitrarily in divorcing her without reasonable   cause   and that the wife will suffer distress and hardship as a result , he may order her divorced husband to pay her compensation equivalent to not more than the sum of maintenance received by her peers over a three-year period , in addition to maintenance during the period of waiting , depending on the circumstances and the degree of arbitrariness . The cadi may order the lump-sum or monthly payment of such compensation , as the case may be .
 Article 117 : If a man divorces his wife and it is clear to the judge that the husband has arbitrarily divorced her without reasonable   cause   and that the wife will suffer distress and hardship as a result , the cadi may order her divorced husband to pay her compensation equivalent to not more than the amount of maintenance received by her peers over a three-year period , in addition to maintenance during the period of waiting , in accordance with the circumstances and the degree of arbitrariness . The cadi may order the lump-sum or monthly payment of such compensation , as the case may be .
 Notwithstanding the obstacles to which I have referred , I am happy to report that Eritrea is projected to achieve eight of the 10 targets by 2015 . We realize , however , that that is no   cause   for celebration , for three reasons. First , Eritrea is off track in two crucial areas , namely the eradication of extreme poverty and the achievement of universal primary education . Secondly , the Millennium Goals , even if they were to be fully achieved , represent only the minimum benchmarks for development .
 It is good that we should hear those statements before contributing ourselves . The European Union has   cause   to be grateful for the role that civil society has played over the past two decades in contributing to the prevention of violent conflict and peacebuilding throughout the world , including within the European Union 's own neighbourhood. We recognize the contribution that civil society makes to strengthening democracy and promoting human rights , both within individual nations and at the global level . Civil society plays an essential role in all phases of the conflict cycle .
 We strongly urge these countries to strictly abide by the above-mentioned principles , to refrain from doing anything further that may provide support to âTaiwan independenceâ secessionists in their attempts to split Taiwan from China , and to adopt the same position on the Taiwan question as the great majority of Member States . We highly appreciate the one-China position adopted by the United Nations and the great majority of its Member States and their support for China 's   cause   of peaceful reunification . We are confident that we , the Chinese Government and people , will continue to enjoy understanding of and extensive support for our just cause of safeguarding State sovereignty and territorial integrity and promoting peaceful reunification of the motherland .
 measures to be taken by the international community should one or both of the parties violate this commitment , including appropriate measures to be taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter by the United Nations Security Council . Accordingly , the violation of the ceasefire Agreement by Eritrea can not be a valid cause for UNMEE to withdraw. It should rather be a valid   cause   for triggering the invocation of Chapter VII of the Charter against the violator . One thing should be clear in this regard , Mr. President .
 âThe Security Council reaffirms its previous calls upon all parties concerned to cooperate fully and urgently with the Security Council for the full implementation of all relevant resolutions concerning the restoration of the territorial integrity , full sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon . âThe Security Council requests the Secretary-General to follow closely the situation in Lebanon and to report urgently on the circumstances ,   causes   and consequences of this terrorist act.â This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2005/4 .
 Article 23 Post-divorce protection of spouses and children : -LRB- cont 'd -RRB- improvements to the Attachment of Income Order Scheme 297 101 Amendments to the Matrimonial   Causes   Rules 298 101 Interest and Surcharge on Arrears of Maintenance Ordinance 2003 299 101
 In 2001 , to address the difficulties that maintenance payees encountered in collecting and enforcing such payments , we introduced further amendments to relax the circumstances in which Attachment of Income Orders could be made. Among other things , those changes empowered the courts to dispense with or relax any procedure or to abridge any time limit specified in the rules under certain circumstances . Amendments to the Matrimonial   Causes   Rules The Matrimonial Causes -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Rules of December 2001 simplify the procedures for handling undefended petitions or joint applications for divorce or judicial separation .
 Amendments to the Matrimonial Causes Rules The Matrimonial   Causes   -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Rules of December 2001 simplify the procedures for handling undefended petitions or joint applications for divorce or judicial separation . The Rules also allow the Court to focus on the substantive issue of the welfare of children in the case by holding private hearings in which the issues can be discussed in an informal and relaxed atmosphere .
 The Palestinian Authority under President Abbas was taking firm steps to implement measures under the first phase of the road map . Those encouraging developments were good   cause   for hope . Draft programme of work of the Committee -LRB- A/AC.183/2005/CRP.1 -RRB-
 Mr. Kafando -LRB- Burkina Faso -RRB- said that , although five years had passed since the international community had adopted the global objective of strengthening the partnership between North and South with a view to ensuring sustainable development , economic disparities had continued to grow and the situation had been made worse by globalization . Nevertheless , the recent World Summit gave   cause   for hope . With regard to financing for development , the Summit Outcome had affirmed the relevance and legitimacy of the Millennium Development Goals , and reiterated the goal that the developed countries should provide official development assistance equivalent to 0.7 per cent of their GNP , as well as setting out a precise timetable for that to be done .
 The United Nations was the natural framework for multilateral efforts against terrorism and lent legitimacy to the struggle . Addressing the underlying   causes   , including long-standing regional conflicts , would contribute to the success of efforts to combat terrorism . In order for the struggle against terrorism to be seen as legitimate , it was important to eschew reductionist thinking that categorized a particular religion , culture or civilization as a hotbed of extremist ideologies .
 Reaffirming its profound commitment to the national unity and stability of Lebanon , emphasizing that the future of Lebanon should be decided through peaceful means by the Lebanese themselves , free of intimidation and foreign interference , and warning in this regard that attempts to undermine the stability of Lebanon will not be tolerated , Taking note of the Commission 's conclusions that , given the infiltration of Lebanese institutions and society by the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services working in tandem , it would be difficult to envisage a scenario whereby such a complex assassination plot could have been carried out without their knowledge , and that there is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials , Mindful of the Commission 's conclusion that while the Syrian authorities , after initial hesitation , have cooperated to a limited degree with the Commission , several Syrian officials have tried to mislead the investigation by giving false or inaccurate statements ,
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . In its resolution 2005/53 , the Commission reiterated and reaffirmed :
 We must not yield any space to terrorism . We must firmly reject any notion that there is any   cause   that justifies it . No cause could ever justify the indiscriminate killing of innocent men , women and children .
 Mr. Kiganahe -LRB- Burundi -RRB- -LRB- spoke in French -RRB- : On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Burundi , which it is my honour to represent here , I should like first to congratulate France on its presidency of the Security Council this month and to thank the its predecessor , Denmark , for its excellent work in May . After two years of intense negotiations , the people of Burundi , in August 2000 , reached the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in order to put an end to the deep-rooted   causes   of the continuous state of violence , insecurity and political instability . Following an in-depth analysis of the historic causes of the conflict , the parties to the negotiations in Arusha agreed , inter alia , to the request of the Transitional Government for the establishment by the Security Council of an international judicial commission of inquiry into the genocide , war crimes and other crimes against humanity .
 Pointing the finger get us nowhere . Yet it is important when researching the   causes   , roots , and background of religiously motivated terrorism not to allow any taboos . After all , terrorists that deny others rights in the name of religion are pursuing an especially dangerous ideology .
 This year 's observance of the National Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the General Assembly 's adoption of resolution 3376 -LRB- XXX -RRB- , of 10 November 1975 , which established the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People . That anniversary is not a   cause   for celebration , but rather an opportunity for the Committee to reflect upon the many years of effort during which the international community and the parties concerned have found themselves powerless in the face of the numerous obstacles on the road to finding a negotiated , comprehensive , just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine . Our meeting today provides us an opportunity once again to express our unwavering commitment to move ahead with resolve towards an equitable solution to the question of Palestine .
 We consider the present plight of the Palestinian people not only a reminder of failed opportunities but also a challenge to members of the Organization to translate that vision into reality . âThe significant milestones that we have attained on this matter over the years are   cause   for satisfaction but should not make us complacent . The international community should not let slip the propitious opportunity to advance the cause of peace , development and security in the region that now presents itself .
 The summit meeting at this session of the General Assembly has substantially stiffened our common resolve to promote international peace and security , the rule of law and the right to development . The assessment of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the renewed commitment of States Members to achieving them are   cause   for hope . The Republic of Guinea nevertheless remains convinced that if we are better to meet the threats and challenges we face , we must resolutely pursue the reforms necessary to revitalize our Organization .
 -LRB- c -RRB- Should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal ; -LRB- d -RRB- Might be removed by the Secretary-General only for   cause   and with the approval of the General Assembly . In the light of the provisions of the resolution mentioned above , the Secretary-General proposes to appoint Inga-Britt Ahlenius -LRB- Sweden -RRB- as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services for one fixed term of five years .
 Thirdly , in practice , the difference in situations of armed conflict in different regions should be taken into consideration , and the various situations should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis . Universal use of one modality should be avoided. The conflicts in the world have different   causes   , natures and directions of development. So do the phases of the peace process . The protection of vulnerable groups such as women and children also requires concrete analysis of the realities of each region. It is impossible to use one protection mechanism to deal with all the situations .
 Note by the Secretary-General -LRB- A/60/85 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB-   Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Report of the Secretary-General -LRB- A/60/182 -RRB-
 It is therefore appropriate to consider them together , for issues of peace and development are closely interlinked and should often be understood in a holistic way . With respect to security , which continues to be the key element in the maintenance of peace and for long-term development , we support the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . They underscore the absolutely crucial necessity of allocating additional resources â human and financial â to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of African Union -LRB- AU -RRB- peacekeeping operations in Darfur , Burundi and Somalia .
 Living in a secure environment , safe from violence or the threat of violence , is crucial for the well-being of all . It is well known that armed conflicts   cause   loss of life , force people to flee their homes , threaten peoples ' basic human rights , undermine development and exacerbate poverty . In addition , violent conflict causes and exacerbates divisions that are extremely difficult to overcome .
 In response to the report , the Council on 19 October adopted a presidential statement -LRB- S/PRST/2004/36 -RRB- , requesting that the Secretary-General report to the Council on the implementation of resolution 1559 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- every six months . On 15 February 2005 , Council members were briefed about the terrorist bomb attack on 14 February that killed the former Prime Minister of Lebanon , Rafiq Hariri , and adopted a presidential statement -LRB- S/PRST/2005/4 -RRB- , in which it strongly condemned the attack and requested the Secretary-General to follow closely the situation in Lebanon and to report urgently on the circumstances ,   causes   and consequences of that terrorist act . On 18 February , the Secretary-General informed the Council of his decision to send a mission of inquiry to Beirut .
 The secretariat said that overall , UNICEF work in child protection was improving , indicators had been developed and more work was being done to support children with disability . Concluding the discussion , the Executive Director said there was a need for more integrated approaches and strengthened partnerships , which would advance the   cause   of children and the Millennium Development Goals . -LRB- See chapter III , decision 2005/10 for the decision adopted by the Executive Board .
 The Minister of Commerce , Science and Technology plays a substantial role in the enforcement of the FCA . The Minister can exempt businesses or activities from the application of the FCA by order subject to affirmative resolution ; appoints the members of the Commission , designates one as its president and fixes their remuneration ; has the power to terminate the appointment of a member , other than the Executive Director , but only for   cause   ; and has the power to grant leave of absence . The Minister can give directions of a general nature as to policy to be followed by the Commission .
 India was determined to confront the challenges and overcome them decisively and completely . That conviction had been expressed clearly by the Prime Minister of India in his statement to the 2005 World Summit , in which he had also emphasized that no   cause   could ever justify the indiscriminate killing of innocent men , women and children . The terrible events of 11 September 2001 in New York had brought home to the world with shocking intensity the profound range and depth of the damage that international terrorism could cause to open societies .

 The Committee is concerned at the increasing level of use of illicit drugs and substances among adolescents . The Committee recommends that the State party undertake a study to carefully analyse the   causes   and consequences of this phenomenon and use the outcome of this study to increase its efforts in order to prevent the use of illicit drugs and substances . Sexual exploitation and trafficking
 I would like to assure the Council that the people of Sierra Leone are determined to muster the same resilience that carried us through those dark days of the rebel conflict to prevent the outbreak of another so-called fratricidal war . We wish to assure the international community that Sierra Leoneans have pledged that never again will Sierra Leoneans give the United Nations , the Economic Community of West African States or any individual State , for that matter ,   cause   to bring troops into our country to end a civil conflict . Of course , we remain concerned about the situation in the West African subregion .
 Matter relating to by-elections The Chairman drew the attention of the members of the Commission to rule 8 , By-elections , of the rules of procedure which read : âIf a member of the Commission dies or resigns or for any other   cause   can no longer perform his or her duties , the Meeting of States Parties shall elect a member for the remainder of the predecessor 's term . Such by-elections shall be carried out in accordance with article 76 and annex II to the Convention.â
 It only remains to note that such âextreme concernâ expressed about Uzbekistan by Western countries which have also in their time been fated to suffer from terrorist acts is somewhat bewildering and raises some doubts as to the sincerity of their concern . The statements by the United States and the European Union give Uzbekistan , in its turn ,   cause   to express some concern as to whether they are truly committed to combating terrorism . For their actions run completely counter to the principles of the fight against terrorism that they themselves have been advancing and proclaiming .
 On 14 February 2005 , former Prime Minister Hariri and 20 others were killed in a callous terrorist attack in central Beirut . Pursuant to a request by the Security Council -LRB- see S/PRST/2005/4 -RRB- , I dispatched to Lebanon a mission of inquiry into the   causes   , circumstances , and consequences of the killing of Mr. Hariri under the leadership of Irish Deputy Police Commissioner Peter FitzGerald , and forwarded its report to the Council on 24 March 2005 -LRB- S/2005/203 -RRB- . That report stated that the assassination seemed to have unlocked the gates of political upheaval and that it had further polarized the political scene to a threatening level .
 My Government pays tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan -LRB- UNAMA -RRB- and the donor countries for their tireless efforts in bringing Afghanistan back within the fold of the international community . There is some   cause   to rejoice as the political process mapped by the Bonn Agreement proceeds . The parliamentary elections planned for 18 September offer a glimmer of hope that this process will continue to give shape to an Afghan political life founded on a constitutionally acceptable and representative Government .
 The fact that there have been such frequent eruptions of conflict on the African continent is really a matter of concern . It is important to undertake a special analysis of the antecedents and   causes   of these conflicts in order to identify the common strands , with a view to addressing the causal factors at the root . It is true that there has been an ongoing debate on the broad causes of conflict globally .
 Sixty years after the founding of the United Nations , terrorism is now at the top of the list of human rights violations . Nothing â no   cause   , religion or moral order â can justify attacks on the lives of innocents , the lives of civilians . We must define acts of terrorism once and for all so that we can better combat that barbaric practice which sets humankind back .
 If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years ' estimates are missing , a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method . If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency , and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the   cause   of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance -LRB- such as inappropriate activity data , emission factors or methods -RRB- , expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1 .

 The present section of the report is in response to Security Council resolution 1539 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , paragraph 3 , requesting information on measures to control illicit subregional and cross-border activities that are harmful to children . Illicit cross-border activities , intrinsically related in terms of their root   causes   and dynamics , have deleterious consequences for children and peace and security . The cross-border abduction and recruitment of children , the trafficking of small arms and light weapons and the illicit exploitation of natural resources all serve to intensify the vulnerability of children in conflict situations , as well as in transitional and post-conflict situations .
 Permanent Representative For the   cause   of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in northeast Asia at large , the Six Parties held , in the spirit of mutual respect and equality , serious and practical talks concerning the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula on the basis of the common understanding of the previous three rounds of talks and agreed in this context to the following : The Six Parties unanimously reaffirmed that the goal of the Six Party Talks is the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner .
 In criminal proceedings arrest is restricted , under international and constitutional human rights requirements , by the necessary grounds , conditions , time limits and the established procedure . An arrest may be ordered only by the court or the pre-trial judge and only when there is probable   cause   to believe that a suspect might obstruct the course of proceedings or will go into hiding from the pre-trial investigation officers or the prosecutor or the court or obstruct the course of the proceedings or commit serious or very serious crimes or medium-gravity crimes listed in the law . An arrest may be employed only in the investigated and considered cases involving crimes which , under criminal law , provide for a stricter penalty than deprivation of liberty for a term of over a year , i.e. imposition of arrest is not allowed in the investigation of misdemeanours and certain crimes , e.g. , provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 140 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania -LRB- causing physical pain or minor health impairment -RRB- .
 An arrest may be employed only in the investigated and considered cases involving crimes which , under criminal law , provide for a stricter penalty than deprivation of liberty for a term of over a year , i.e. imposition of arrest is not allowed in the investigation of misdemeanours and certain crimes , e.g. , provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 140 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania -LRB- causing physical pain or minor health impairment -RRB- . The draft law provides for a new preventive measure - obligating the suspect to reside separately from the victim if there is justified   cause   to believe that suspect residing together with the victim will attempt to exert upon the victim an unlawful influence or commit new criminal acts against the victim or the persons residing together with him . The measure may be imposed by the pre-trial judge or upon the court ruling whereby the judge/the court will also be able to obligate the suspect to refrain from communicating or seeking communication with the victim or the persons residing together with him , also refrain from visiting certain places visited by the victim or persons residing together with the victim .
 To date , a total of 44 clinically confirmed cases have been reported in the Darfur states since 1 January 2005 . There is   cause   for concern , especially as overcrowded camps and the continuous movements at borders between the Sudan and Chad could increase the risk that the disease will spread . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- and its partners are presently monitoring the situation in and around Darfur .
 Thirdly , the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal . Finally , the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services might be removed by the Secretary-General only for   cause   and with the approval of the General Assembly . In the light of the provisions of resolution 48/218 B , the Secretary-General proposes to appoint Ms. Inga-Britt Ahlenius of Sweden as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services for one fixed term of five years .
 In 1999- 2002 : SAK was pushing hard to seek certain policy changes within purview of Maharashtra State in India . It campaigned and lobbied for the   cause   of women 's issues , particularly women 's state level policy . Currently , SAK is the State level forum for women 's issues .
 The problem hampered the peace negotiations between the Government and the armed opposition . Another   cause   was the inability of the Darfur states , with their legislative , executive and security institutions , to grasp the problem and to tackle it at the outset . Another cause was the erroneous approach of certain States , which exerted constant pressure on the Government in order to solve the problem .
 Among all the health indicators , maternal mortality rates reflect some of the greatest disparities between developed and developing countries . Ninety-nine per cent of maternal deaths worldwide occur in developing countries , and in poor countries as many as 30 per cent of deaths among women of reproductive age -LRB- 15-49 years -RRB- may be from pregnancy-related   causes   , compared with rates of less than 1 per cent for developed countries . In 2000 , there were 400 maternal deaths per 100 , 000 live births in developing regions , a ratio 19 times higher than in developed regions .
 Emergency situations An aquifer State shall , without delay and by the most expeditious means available , notify other potentially affected States and competent international organizations of any emergency situation originating within its territory that   causes   , or poses an imminent threat of causing , serious harm to other States and that results suddenly from natural causes or from human conduct . An aquifer State within whose territory an emergency situation originates shall , in cooperation with potentially affected States and , where appropriate , competent international organizations , immediately take all practicable measures necessitated by the circumstances to prevent , mitigate and eliminate harmful effects of the emergency situation .
 Reaffirming its profound commitment to the national unity and stability of Lebanon , emphasizing that the future of Lebanon should be decided through peaceful means by the Lebanese themselves , free of intimidation and foreign interference , and warning in this regard that attempts to undermine the stability of Lebanon will not be tolerated , Taking note of the Commission 's conclusions that , given the infiltration of Lebanese institutions and society by the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services working in tandem , it would be difficult to envisage a scenario whereby such a complex assassination plot could have been carried out without their knowledge , and that there is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials , Mindful of the Commission 's conclusion that while the Syrian authorities , after initial hesitation , have cooperated to a limited degree with the Commission , several Syrian officials have tried to mislead the investigation by giving false or inaccurate statements ,
 Recognizing that acts of deportation or forcible transfer of populations which , inter alia , lead to or result from mass exoduses and displacements are included as crimes against humanity in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , and recognizing also the importance of ending impunity for perpetrators of such crimes , Recognizing also that the human rights machinery of the United Nations , including the mechanisms of the Commission and the human rights treaty bodies , has important capabilities for addressing human rights violations that   cause   movements of refugees and displaced persons or prevent durable solutions to their plight , Welcoming the Agenda for Protection , emanating from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Global Consultations on International Protection , which was endorsed by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner 's Programme and welcomed by the General Assembly and noting in this context the elements that relate to refugees in mass influx situations , including those relating to the problem of insecurity in refugee camps and the importance of refugee registration ,
 Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei chaired the talks . For the   cause   of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia at large , the Six Parties held , in the spirit of mutual respect and equality , serious and practical talks concerning the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula on the basis of the common understanding of the previous three rounds of talks , and agreed , in this context , to the following : The Six Parties unanimously reaffirmed that the goal of the Six-Party Talks is the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner .
 Recalling further the creation by the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 2002/1 of 15 July 2002 , of ad hoc advisory groups on African countries emerging from conflict , Having considered the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome , through which world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the special needs of Africa ,
 Noting that conflict prevention and the consolidation of peace would benefit from the coordinated , sustained and integrated efforts of the United Nations system and Member States , and regional and subregional organizations , as well as international and regional financial institutions , Reaffirming that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa must remain a priority in the agenda of the United Nations system and for Member States , Stressing that the responsibility for peace and security in Africa , including the capacity to address the root causes of conflict and to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner , lies primarily with African countries , while recognizing the need for support from the international community ,
 Calls for the enhancement of the role of women in conflict prevention , conflict resolution , and post-conflict peacebuilding and for expanding gender mainstreaming in the work of United Nations organizations involved in peacemaking , peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction ; Decides to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ; Stresses the importance of enabling the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa to better fulfil its role as the focal point within the Secretariat for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General referred to in paragraph 18 above ;
 Indeed , former Secretary-General Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld lost his life in the context of that explosive political mix . As Africa struggles to set its house in order , Uganda has identified four main   causes   of conflict on the continent which negative forces have exploited for their own ends . They include parasitic vested interests ; superficiality and obscurantism in identifying and dealing with those parasitic interests and their effects on a particular country or group of countries ; weak and disoriented local leadership ; and , finally , the pre-industrial characteristics of Africa .
 To continue , it is necessary for us to get through the next set of impediments before us so that we actually realize the goals we have set . We have   cause   for at least some optimism because so much of what we have to do now repeats the initial process of setting the MDGs . Utilizing our knowledge , our understanding of how to work together , and our agreements as pylons , we have to construct a bridge from our goals to our intended accomplishments .
 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration , adopted on 8 September 2000 by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations , and especially chapter VII thereof , Bearing in mind the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Welcoming the establishment of the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa with a view to creating a climate of peace and security in the subregion and strengthening the rule of law essential to its development ,
 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had demonstrated the pertinence and usefulness of the Convention in addressing new and contemporary forms of discrimination , xenophobia and intolerance . The European Union urged all States to ratify the Convention and implement all its provisions as a matter of priority ; to adopt measures to combat the symptoms and   causes   of racism and discrimination ; and to cooperate fully with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and the Anti-Discrimination Unit of OHCHR . The European Union had participated actively in the work of the third session of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in October 2004 .
 For some , their very existence is in jeopardy . United Nations conferences from Rio to Johannesburg and Monterrey , and above all 10 years ago in Barbados , have sought to rally the world behind the   cause   of small island developing states . There has been progress .
 If the preliminary inquiry appears to indicate that the report of serious misconduct is well founded , the head of mission shall establish a board of inquiry . The board of inquiry is to establish the facts and determine   causes   and responsibility in the incident under review , and may also make recommendations for appropriate administrative action , including repatriation . The Directives also state that the board of inquiry is a management tool to assist the head of mission in discharging his or her responsibilities .
 Our region is inundated with such weapons following many decades of inter- and intra-State conflicts in some of our States . As a region , we clearly have much   cause   for concern and have a clear incentive to arrest their spread . SADC has been a strong advocate in the fight against that scourge .
 Conclusion There is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials and could not have been further organized without the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security services .

 I am happy to report that Eritrea is projected to achieve most of the targets by 2015 . Yet we realize that that is no   cause   for celebration , for three reasons. First , Eritrea is off-track in two crucial areas : the eradication of extreme poverty and the achievement of universal primary education . Secondly , the general consensus is that , even if they were to be fully achieved , the MDGs represent only the minimum benchmarks rather than the culmination of full development itself .
 Although 75 per cent of the population now has access to essential drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis , fatal infections of this kind remain a serious public health problem among children . Moreover , malnutrition remains a worrying   cause   of child mortality/morbidity . The Government conducts a number of activities through the centres for recovery and nutritional education -LRB- CREN -RRB- , the school canteens project and the food-for-work programme .
 Having studied the report carefully , however , it is difficult not to endorse its conclusion that there is converging evidence pointing at both Lebanese and Syrian official involvement in this terrorist act . âThere is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials and could not have been further organized without the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security services.â Let us be clear .
 Just to be clear about this â and this is why I wholly reject any comparison between the position of the Governments of the United States , of Spain and of the United Kingdom and that of the Government of Syria â the independent commissioner concludes , in paragraph 124 , that âThere is probable   cause   to believe that the decision to assassinate former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officialsâ . If Mr. Al-Shara ' is suggesting that what happened on 11 September 2001 , 3 March 2004 and 7 July 2005 happened with the approval of the Governments of the United States , of Spain and of the United Kingdom , I think that he ought to say so .
 -LRB- ii -RRB- The expected loss of civilian life , injury to civilians , damage to civilian objects , or a combination thereof caused by duds must be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated . If an attack can be expected to generate ERW , which would in turn   cause   excessively high collateral damages , the attack could be seen as disproportionate and hence illegal . -LRB- iii -RRB- Precautions in attack
 Companies which claim delivery In paragraph 4 of the annex to my letter of 8 August 2005 , I informed the Council that funding was being retained even after the expiry of some letters of credit because the United Nations Secretariat had   cause   to believe that goods associated with some of those letters of credit were delivered to Iraq and payments might need to be provided to the vendor . The relevant authorities in Iraq have not yet , however , provided the United Nations with authentication documents necessary for payments to be made to some of the companies claiming to have delivered goods in accordance with the terms and conditions of their letters of credit .
 While the normal practice for the programme has been to close a letter of credit 90 days after expiry , because of the difficulties being encountered in the processing of the authentication documents which are required for payment to be made to the vendor , funding has been retained in the United Nations Iraq Account for the expired letters of credit . This is because the United Nations Secretariat has   cause   to believe that deliveries were made during the validity period of the letters of credit , and is awaiting receipt , from the Government of Iraq , of the authentication documents . The Council is requested to urge the responsible authorities to promptly process the authentication documents so that payment can be made according to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit .
 Reaffirming its unequivocal condemnation of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut , Lebanon , that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and others , and caused injury to dozens of people , and condemning the subsequent attacks in Lebanon , Having examined the report of the fact-finding mission to Lebanon inquiring into the circumstances ,   causes   and consequences of this terrorist act -LRB- S/2005/203 -RRB- , transmitted to the Security Council by the Secretary-General following the declaration of the President of the Security Council of 15 February 2005 -LRB- S/PRST/2005/4 -RRB- , Noting with concern the fact-finding mission 's conclusion that the Lebanese investigation process suffers from serious flaws and has neither the capacity nor the commitment to reach a satisfactory and credible conclusion ,
 The three pillars mentioned in the presidency 's discussion paper for this debate are all on the checklist . The rule of law , security-sector reform and disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes are vital parts of every peacebuilding strategy , as they address the fundamental   causes   of most conflicts . To improve our work , we must develop individual peacebuilding strategies for every conflict .
 However , humanitarian action alone should not be a substitute for needed political action . The Security Council should be knowledgeable about and concerned by early signs of the multiple root   causes   of humanitarian crises , both man-made and caused by natural disasters . Such knowledge would enable the Council to initiate early action to prevent or contain the outbreak of full-scale conflict .
 This response is all the more timely since the terrorist hydra attacks the sanctity of life , defies all reason and undermines the foundations of the rights and freedoms of the individual . It is the view of Senegal that , quite frankly , there is no   cause   sufficiently just or sufficiently good to justify the use of terrorism and the massacre of women , children and innocent civilians . Last but not least , the Middle East continues to send us daily images of a seemingly endless tragedy for the Palestinian people .
 Bulgaria categorically condemns terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations . No   cause   can justify violence against innocent people . The United Nations has a leading and irreplaceable role in creating a global environment of intolerance and rejection of terrorism .
 A new timetable is to be proposed for the compensation of victims ' families and related claimholders and the restitution of confiscated property . At the end of its mandate , the Equity and Reconciliation Commission will submit a report setting out the   causes   , political motives and responsibilities for events over the past 40 years . It will also submit proposals to the Executive so that the latter may take appropriate decisions to ensure that such human rights abuses are never perpetrated again .
 Citizens shall be guaranteed the right to inviolability of residence . No one shall have the right to enter a residence against the wishes of the persons residing there without lawful   cause   . The personal privacy of citizens and privacy of correspondence , telephone conversations and telegraph communications shall be protected by law .
 1 , of the Convention -RRB- . Although this liability would accrue to the registrar and the registrar has to procure financial guarantees covering its liability to the extent determined by the supervisory authority , the risk that a person who has suffered a loss will or will also seek compensatory damages from the supervisory authority , though it would seem to be remote , can not be eliminated . Whether there would be sufficient ground to hold the supervisory authority liable in practice would ultimately depend on the   cause   of action and the nature of the relationship between the registrar and the supervisory authority . Although the United Nations would enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in such cases before municipal courts , the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations -LRB- General Assembly resolution 22 A -LRB- I -RRB- -RRB- requires the United Nations to make provision for appropriate modes of settlement of disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private law character to which the United Nations is a party -LRB- sect .
 We have in place various worthwhile initiatives , forums and bodies â all of which are in need of a comprehensive approach to streamline their activities . Reading the list of the major   causes   of conflict in Africa â starting with endemic poverty and widespread underdevelopment , and in some cases undemocratic , weak or nonexistent Government institutions , and political and economic discrimination â one realizes that a single United Nations body can not do the job alone . Most of the issues that I have just referred to fall under the purview of various bodies and organizations of the United Nations system .
 In fact , since the publication of An Agenda for Peace -LRB- S/24111 -RRB- in 1992 , other reports and other studies have enriched our collective knowledge of conflicts and as a result have assisted in the development of relevant approaches for conflict prevention . The reports of the Secretary-General â the most recent of which have to do , respectively , with the   causes   of conflict in Africa and the promotion of sustainable peace and development in Africa , and the possibilities and challenges of partnership in the area of security on a regional and a global scale â contain an analysis and relevant proposals that only need to be implemented . Additionally , the General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted decisions that , unfortunately , have not been completely implemented .
 Although the United Nations has in the past limited itself to acting as a firefighter , in recent years it has had limited success in emphasizing prevention . Since the issuance of the Secretary-General 's excellent report -LRB- S/1998/318 -RRB- entitled âThe   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ , several ideas have been proposed regarding the crucial question of conflict prevention and the role of the Security Council as regards peace and security , especially in Africa . The report also included several positive concrete measures to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africa .
 Sanctions should be imposed within a precise time frame ; they should be periodically reviewed and lifted once they had fulfilled their purpose . Care should be taken to ensure that they did not have the opposite effect to that intended and   cause   harm both to target States and to third States . In practice , despite the efforts made , they affected innocent civilian populations and led to the economic destabilization of target States and/or third States .
 Continued support and increased development assistance by the donor community within the framework of the Afghanistan Compact -LRB- S/2006/90 , annex -RRB- are vital to tackling the problem of manufacture of and trafficking in heroin from Afghanistan . However , there has been no   cause   for complacency in the rapidly shifting trends of drug abuse and trafficking . At the Dialogue on Shared Responsibility and the Global Problem of Illicit Drugs , held in London on 2 November 2006 , the Executive Director of UNODC highlighted an upward trend in cocaine abuse in Europe .
 The Commission heard a statement on behalf of Unidroit , reporting on progress with a number of projects outlined in document A/CN.9/628 and Add.1 , including the following : -LRB- a -RRB- The Working Group on the Principles of International Commercial Contracts held its second session in June 2007 and made substantial progress on the unwinding of failed contracts , plurality of obligors and of obligees , termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   and initial progress on illegality. An intersessional meeting of a drafting committee would be held ; -LRB- b -RRB- The fourth session of the Unidroit Committee of Governmental Experts was held in May 2007 to further consider the draft Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities .
 If a person who entered into a custom marriage wished to remarry , he or she would need first to obtain a divorce in accordance with that person 's specific customs . In cases of civil marriages , a married person who wished to remarry would be required to obtain a formal divorce through the courts under the Matrimonial   Causes   Act . Customs in Vanuatu varied among the some 80 inhabited islands and even among different villages on the same islands .
 Stressing that the responsibility for peace and security in Africa , including the capacity to address the root causes of conflict and to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner , lies primarily with African countries , while recognizing the need for support from the international community , Recognizing , in particular , the importance of strengthening the capacity of the African Union and subregional organizations to address the   causes   of conflict in Africa , Noting that despite the positive trends and advances in obtaining durable peace in Africa , the conditions required for sustainable development have yet to be consolidated throughout the continent and that there is therefore an urgent need to develop African human and institutional capacities , particularly in countries emerging from conflict ,
 Pursuant to the recommendation of the Governing Council of Unidroit , the Principles of International Commercial Contracts -LRB- PICC -RRB- , first published in 1994 , are included as an on going project in the work programme of the Institute . Subsequent to the adoption of the second enlarged edition of the PICC in 2004 , in 2005 the Governing Council decided to set up a new Working Group with the task of preparing a third edition of the PICC including new chapters on unwinding of failed contracts , plurality of obligors and of obligees , termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   . The Working Group , composed of eminent experts representing the major legal systems and/or regions of the world as well as observers from international organizations and arbitration centres , including UNCITRAL , held its first session in Rome from 29 May to 1 June 2006 .
 The Working Group , composed of eminent experts representing the major legal systems and/or regions of the world as well as observers from international organizations and arbitration centres , including UNCITRAL , held its first session in Rome from 29 May to 1 June 2006 . On the basis of a preliminary study prepared by the Unidroit Secretariat , the Group proceeded to an in-depth discussion of the five topics suggested for inclusion in the new edition of the Principles and appointed several rapporteurs to deal with the topics of : unwinding of failed contracts ; illegality ; plurality of obligors and of obligees ; conditions ; and termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   . The Rapporteurs were invited to prepare position papers on their respective topics for discussion at the Group 's next session in June 2007 .

 To allow for focused action , the European Union has chosen all forms of violence against children as its first priority area and has adopted , together with guidelines , an implementation strategy for specific measures to be taken in that area . A further   cause   for celebration is the adherence by United Nations Member States to the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , namely , on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , each of which now has over 100 States parties . All EU member States have signed and almost all have ratified or acceded to both of them .
 The International Council of Voluntary Agencies -LRB- ICVA -RRB- is an association of non-governmental organisations from around the world that works as a collective body , to promote , and advocate for , human rights and a humanitarian perspective in global debates and responses . The heart of the ICVA mission is to support NGOs to protect and assist people in need , to address the   causes   of their plight , and to act as a channel for translating patterns and trends into advocacy . ICVA advocates vis-Ã -vis governments and international agencies for a strong NGO role in efforts to secure human rights , prevent conflicts , prepare for disasters , and improve humanitarian responses to distressed populations .
 All the interlocutors that the mission met indicated that Timor-Leste is experiencing stability and peace . However , there is a collective view that the issues of the IDPs , the so-called âpetitionersâ who are former soldiers who deserted the army and the unresolved case of Major Alfredo Reinado , who also left the army ,   cause   uncertainty and divisions among the people and leadership of Timor-Leste . In its meetings with interlocutors , the mission emphasized the need for political dialogue , reconciliation and political engagement among the country 's leadership .

Remarks
 In this context , a distinction must be made between the successive phases of a -LRB- potential -RRB- conflict . -LRB- a -RRB- From a conflict-prevention perspective , the question is how to prevent natural resources from becoming a   cause   of conflict ; governance of natural resources is a key issue in this respect ; -LRB- b -RRB- In the case of conflict , the challenge becomes how to prevent the exploitation of natural resources from fuelling and perpetuating war .
 He therefore proposed deleting recommendation 62 and discussing the options instead in the commentary , emphasizing that although the issue was theoretically important , it rarely arose in practice . Mr. Bazinas -LRB- Secretariat -RRB- asked whether the representative of France had reservations regarding the requirement for the grantor to inform the secured party because a breach of that obligation would create a contractual   cause   of action . Ms. StanivukoviÄ -LRB- Serbia -RRB- said that if recommendation 62 were to be deleted , it would also be necessary to delete recommendation 61 since they were both designed to protect the good faith of third parties that had relied on information contained in the registry .
 On 15 February , the members of the Security Council agreed on a statement to the press on the terrorist attack on a bus in the south-eastern city of Zahedan , in the Islamic Republic of Iran . They condemned the attack , carried out on 14 February , which killed at least 18 people and wounded many more , and reiterated that no   cause   could justify the use of terrorist violence . They underlined the need to bring the perpetrators , organizers and sponsors of the terrorist attack , and of all terrorist attacks , to justice .
 They condemned the terrorist bombing , carried out on 19 February , in which 67 people were killed and nearly 20 injured , including a large number of Pakistani and Indian nationals . They also reiterated that no   cause   could justify the use of terrorist violence and underlined the need to bring the perpetrators , organizers and sponsors of that attack , as well as all acts of terrorism , to justice . They reaffirmed the need to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and by all means under international law , in particular international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law .
 We welcome the progress made , but we must condemn the violation of human rights in Myanmar and the continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi . Although every conflict has its own particular   causes   , we can say that violations of the human rights of certain groups , a culture of impunity or the absence of strong institutions able to guarantee the human rights of all are the common denominator of most conflicts . In Africa , there are examples of how institutional weakness and abuses of human rights become the main causes of conflict .
 That once again brought to the fore the necessity of developing common needs assessments â to further discuss the roles and mandates of the relevant actors , such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , the European Commission 's Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection of the EU . Poverty , armed conflicts and natural disasters such as floods , tsunamis and forest fires are all   causes   of another global problem â forced migration , which should also be tackled in a more concerted manner by the whole international community . Being forced to leave one 's home is always a tragedy .
 Mr. Forshaw -LRB- Australia -RRB- , speaking on behalf of the CANZ group of countries -LRB- Australia , Canada and New Zealand -RRB- , said that the CANZ group reaffirmed its strong condemnation of all acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and recognized that terrorism continued to present a serious challenge to international peace and security . Targeting and deliberate killing through acts of terrorism could not be justified or legitimized by any   cause   or grievance . Although counter-terrorism measures had significantly disrupted terrorist networks , there was no room for complacency , since terrorist groups had demonstrated a capacity for innovation and resilience .
 The Chadian people , victims of insecurity due to the interminable armed struggles for power , condemn these sterile struggles and rely on the democratic political actors and on the international community to block the path to violence . If we must extend a hand to the rebels , whose   causes   sometimes seem to be from the world of a revolutionary utopia , this should not be done to the detriment of the highest interest of the rule of law and of democracy . Unhappiness is at the heart of rebellions .
 It was noted that such impacts of trafficking had been researched inadequately and indicators to measure effectively the impacts on families were lacking . It was recommended that organizations focusing on migration , including the International Organization for Migration , investigate the   causes   of trafficking and develop comprehensive indicators for cross-country analyses . Models for assessing trafficking flows , identifying early warning signals and assessing the impact of trafficking on countries of origin , including costs to public health systems , were needed .
 Specific programmes focusing on capacity-building and basic social services for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States are currently under development . Although the delivery of these and other peace dividends has been offset by slower than expected disbursement through the multi-donor trust funds , the achievements made so far in Southern Sudan give   cause   for optimism . These include an expansion of markets and an increase in trade , with a significant reduction in the cost of basic items in key locations , such as Juba .
 After carefully examining the relevant cases , the Court noted that the âpublic policyâ requirement in MAL 34 -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- imposed a high threshold . It found that the applicant 's   causes   of action were so clearly unfounded that they could not possibly succeed . It also found that there was evidentiary basis for the arbitral tribunal 's findings and thus dismissed the application of the applicant .
 The Chinese Government has always made every effort to promote with all sincerity peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful reunification. However , we will never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China in name or in any other way . We hope that the international community will continue to support China 's   cause   of peaceful reunification , support the Chinese people in opposing and repulsing separatist activities for âTaiwan independenceâ and work with us to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-Pacific region . The Olympic Games , which represent humanity 's aspiration for peace , development , cooperation and friendship , will for the first time be held in China , a country both ancient and youthful , starting on 8 August 2008 .
 On 1 June 2007 , a major explosion occurred in one of the satellite camps connected to main cantonment site 7 . An investigation was unable to fully resolve divergent reports concerning the   cause   of the accident and the explosives involved . Fortunately , it appears that there were no casualties .
 I would also like to thank him for his unstinting personal support for the work of the United Nations in the Middle East . Since my last briefing to the Council , there have been a number of important political developments giving   cause   for hope . Most notable is the re-engagement of the international community and Israel with the Government of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .
 For example , if an employee has an accident resulting in a physical disability , whether at or outside the workplace , which requires the employee to use a wheelchair in the future , the employer now has a responsibility to provide , for example , ramps , clear corridors , ensure wheelchair accessible toilets and make other adjustments and modifications so that the persons can continue to work as an active employee . A failure to make such accommodations would give rise to a   cause   of action so that the individual employee could bring a claim to an appropriate judicial or quasi-judicial body on the ground of discrimination . However , the accommodations that the employer must undertake are not unlimited ; they must only be âreasonableâ such that , for example , a disproportionately expensive accommodation would not be mandatory .
 There had been positive developments in the human rights situation in Myanmar , such as the country visit by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and measures to halt the use of child soldiers . However , the fact that Myanmar was preventing the Special Rapporteur for human rights from making a visit was   cause   for concern . Mr. Kyaw Tint Swe -LRB- Myanmar -RRB- said that the no-action motion preceding the vote on draft resolution A/C.3/61/L.38/Rev.1 indicated that the international community would no longer tolerate the politicization of human rights issues by means of country-specific resolutions .
 Furthermore , some delays were the result of a âculture of litigationâ that could be discouraged by creating a selective appeals mechanism . Lastly , he noted that the Administrative Tribunal had only two lawyers on its staff ; additional legal officers should be recruited and the Office of Legal Affairs should be granted the power to mediate or intervene in disputes since , in practice , the Organization sometimes found itself defending a lost   cause   . Mr. Elmarghani -LRB- Libyan Arab Jamahiriya -RRB- said that a transparent system of justice was needed in order to allow United Nations staff to exercise their rights effectively and in a timely manner .

 We are confident that such dialogue will establish the truth that Islam is a religion that espouses universalism and not exclusivity , and tolerance rather than bigotry . Malaysia is equally convinced that it is wrong to put the blame on religion as the   cause   of existing disputes between nations . All genuine religions advocate peace and harmony among peoples , as well as acceptance of others .
 It is our wish that this Conference of Parties should seek to achieve substantial and legally binding emission reductions in the shortest possible period , as well as explore ways to significantly increase the level of resources available to developing countries , and to the small island developing States , in particular , to assist in adapting to the impacts of climate change . While economic and trade policy reform , in principle , holds much promise for small developing countries , the international community must understand that the âone size fits allâ approach to trade arrangements is inappropriate and unrealistic and will not advance the   cause   of equitable global economic development . This approach has led to a reversal in many small States of the progress made through hard work and sacrifice by their populations .
 The majority of Palestinians being illegally imprisoned or arbitrarily detained by Israel are subject to extremely harsh living conditions and constant physical and mental ill-treatment , including coercive interrogations and humiliation , and many of them are subject to torture . The inhumane treatment of Palestinian prisoners at the hands of the occupying Power has been the   cause   of widespread suffering and trauma among the prisoners and has led to the death of at least 190 Palestinian prisoners over the many years of this prolonged and bitter foreign occupation of the Palestinian land and people . In this regard , I regret to inform you of the death today of a Palestinian prisoner , Mohammed Al-Ashqar , 33 years of age , who died as a result of the critical wounds he sustained yesterday , 22 October , at the southern Israeli detention camp of Al-Naqab -LRB- Ketziot -RRB- in the Negev , when Israeli guards fired upon prisoners with live ammunition and tear gas , injuring at least 250 other prisoners .
 The advisory opinion of 2004 of the International Court of Justice on the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory contained legal opinions that would promote a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on international law . Terrorism was , and always would be , politically and morally condemnable ; no   cause   justified such action . For dialogue and negotiation to succeed , such practices must be renounced .
 It also indicates that the authors unsuccessfully challenged the urbanization plan that gave rise to the eviction , as well as the Cartagena City Council order of 4 October 2000 , under which the eviction order was placed before three separate courts , the Administrative Court of Murcia , the Administrative Chamber of the Murcia Superior Court of Justice and the Supreme Court , none of which found grounds to suspend the enforceability of the corresponding administrative act . The case then went before the Constitutional Court , which upheld the measure on three occasions following appeals that failed to invoke the inviolability of the home , referring only to infringement of the right to âeffective legal protectionâ for lack of a hearing and due   cause   , among other things . 4.5 Moreover , the specific manner of the eviction was also challenged before the Administrative Chamber of the Murcia Superior Court of Justice , a step that can only be considered as a judicial review of the lawfulness and validity of the eviction .
 As for a woman 's right to divorce or to dissolution of the marriage contract , the law gives her the right to apply for separation on grounds of hurt . If the husband is absent without good   cause   , the wife may apply for divorce , if she suffers hurt because of his absence . The same applies if the husband is sentenced to imprisonment or refuses to support her adequately .
 The African participation in UNMIS and UNAMID was right and proper . Her delegation looked forward to sustainable post-conflict solutions in the Sudan and urged implementation of General Assembly resolution 61/230 on implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . Mr. Muhith -LRB- Bangladesh -RRB- said that his delegation was fully aware that UNAMID was a complex mission with a challenging mandate in a difficult environment and that , owing to the time factor , a number of extraordinary measures had been put in place to implement Security Council resolution 1769 -LRB- 2007 -RRB- .
 In this case , there will essentially be three parties involved , namely the certification services provider , the signatory and the relying third party . To the extent that their acts or omissions   cause   harm to any of the others , or contravene their express or implied duties , each could become liable , or may lose the right to assert liability , against another party . -LRB- a -RRB- No specific provisions on standards of conduct or liability .
 Where a tort is committed in the performance of acts governed by a contract , common law jurisdictions have traditionally required some privity of contract between the tortfeasor and the injured party . Since the relying third party does not enter into a contract with the certification services provider and probably does not interact with the certification services provider at all , except for relying on the false certification , it may be difficult in some common law jurisdictions -LRB- absent an explicit statutory provision -RRB- for the relying party to establish a   cause   of action against the certification services provider . If there is no privity of contract , a cause of action at tort under the common law would require a showing of a breach of a duty of care owed by the tortfeasor to the injured party .
 Since the relying third party does not enter into a contract with the certification services provider and probably does not interact with the certification services provider at all , except for relying on the false certification , it may be difficult in some common law jurisdictions -LRB- absent an explicit statutory provision -RRB- for the relying party to establish a cause of action against the certification services provider . If there is no privity of contract , a   cause   of action at tort under the common law would require a showing of a breach of a duty of care owed by the tortfeasor to the injured party . Whether or not for the certification services provider such a duty exists in respect of all possible relying parties is not entirely clear .
 Globally in 2002 , AIDS was the fourth leading cause of death . If the scaling up of AIDS treatment programmes consists solely of scaling up antiretroviral therapy without scaling up prevention , it is estimated that by 2030 AIDS will become the third leading   cause   of death . However , when combined with effective prevention programmes , it is estimated that the AIDS-related disease burden and mortality will be substantially reduced -LRB- table 1 -RRB- .
 Although AIDS prevalence is extremely low in Bangladesh , there is little room for complacency , as we are in a high-incidence zone . There is   cause   for great concern about entering into concentrated expansion among high-risk groups . The vulnerability of Bangladesh to HIV/AIDS is high , owing to the prevalence of HIV in neighbouring countries , increased population movement through internal and external migration and lack of adequate awareness among the general population about HIV infection .
 It was recalled that draft article 13 -LRB- Cases of termination or suspension -RRB- simply made the obvious point that the draft was without prejudice to the provisions set forth in the Vienna Convention of 1969 . As in the law of tort , there might be several overlapping   causes   of action . Thus , the effect of war on treaties might be paralleled by other types of fundamental change of circumstances .
 Similarly , in a world with an expanding population , spreading deserts and melting glaciers , access to water â which is often shared â is likely to emerge as an existential issue for many nations and peoples . It could become the   cause   of a host of disputes and conflicts . It is time for the international community to construct an international regime that ensures equitable access to and availability of water for all peoples and all States .
 In order to ensure that the Protocol has the desired impact for civilian populations affected by the scourge of explosive remnants of war , the first conference of States parties , in which my country will participate , should decide upon measures essential for its implementation . The ban on cluster weapons that   cause   unacceptable damage to civilian populations has been , and continues to be , fundamental for achieving the objective that Switzerland has set itself . Switzerland will work to ensure that the new legal provisions are effective on the ground and accepted globally .
 That formulation could help in unlocking the stalemate on the outstanding issues . No   cause   , ideology , religion , creed or grievance justified terrorism , and moral relativism and ideological considerations had no place in the search for a definition . Member States should work towards a convention that had moral clarity and credibility , and that would command the respect of the international community .
 The State party should submit in its next periodic report information regarding the implementation of article 3 of the Convention in cases of extradition , expulsion or return -LRB- refoulement -RRB- of foreigners . -LRB- 9 -RRB- While taking note of the efforts made by the State party in addressing the issue of the ethnic composition in the Guyana Police Force , the Committee is concerned at the reduced presence of persons of Indo-Guyanese origin in the police force , which would appear to be among the underlying   causes   of the high number of deaths in custody of persons of Indo-Guyanese origin . The State party should continue its efforts to diversify the ethnic composition of the Guyana Police Force and take appropriate measures to prevent the incidence of deaths in custody .
 â¢ The establishment of a minimum in-house capacity for investigations ; â¢ The appointment of a qualified internal oversight head , subject to consultation and prior consent of the governing bodies ; and termination for just   cause   , subject to review and consent of the governing bodies ; â¢ Term limits for external auditors and for the head of internal oversight , with no expectation of employment within the same United Nations organization at the end of the term ;
 There is also a strong recognition by members of the continuing vital role of the Commission as a viable multilateral deliberating body dealing with disarmament and non-proliferation problems . This is a great source of encouragement and   cause   for further dedication to the process . A candid assessment of the root causes of the setbacks largely points , on one hand , to the political and security-related sensitivity and complexity of the subject matter in question and , on the other hand , to the inherent weaknesses deeply embedded in the multilateral arms control process .
 For other violations punishable under the Revised Penal Code , the action is filed in the name of the People of the Philippines . The offended party files a complaint before the prosecutor , or in places where there are no such office before the municipal trial court of the place where the offense was committed , which would then conduct a preliminary investigation or examination to determine whether there is reasonable   cause   to believe that the crime punishable under the Code has probably been committed . The finding of the prosecutor or the judge is forwarded to the Provincial Public Prosecutor 's Office which then files the corresponding information to the regular courts which , in turn , would determine the culpability of the offender and impose the necessary penalty .
 Article 279 of the Labor Code assures the right of workers to security of tenure . As such , an employee may not be dismissed except for a just   cause   or when authorized by law , i.e. , closure of business operations or redundancy of the employee 's position . Article 277 -LRB- b -RRB- of the Labor Code provides for the twin requirements of notice and hearing prior to termination of employment .
 Need we emphasize , to illustrate that concept , that any initiative to increase official development assistance and deal equitably with debt strengthens democracy ? Any initiative aimed at preserving the environment and mitigating the effects of climate change also serves the   cause   of democracy . The fourth pillar is respect for human rights .
 Nevertheless , she stressed the need to increase the number of girls at the primary and secondary levels in order to have greater numbers entering higher education . Mr. Vahnavati -LRB- India -RRB- said that there was no   cause   to be disheartened regarding the goal of achieving registration of marriages because the Supreme Court order relating to the issue had now arrived and such orders always expedited the implementation process . The Supreme Court had a unique role in India because it had the power to pass general orders on any matter in order to achieve substantive justice and Government always accepted and enforced those orders .
 The Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 2002/1 , created a framework for advisory groups on African countries emerging from conflict with a view to assessing the humanitarian and economic needs of those countries and elaborating a long-term programme of support beginning with the integration of relief into development . At the time , the Council was responding to a request made by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/217 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . In response to that request , the Council created the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau in October 2002 -LRB- decision 2002/304 -RRB- , as the first pilot case .
 It is precisely for that reason that the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General , in collaboration with and building upon the work undertaken by UNESCO , to establish a programme of educational outreach to mobilize , inter alia , educational institutions and civil society on the subject of remembering the transatlantic slave trade and slavery . As indicated in the draft resolution , the main purpose is to inculcate future generations with the   causes   , consequences and lessons of the transatlantic slave trade and to inform of the dangers of racism and slavery . The programme of educational outreach , as contemplated in the draft resolution , and which is indeed of critical importance to its implementation , should not present any significant budgetary implications beyond that approved by the General Assembly for other similar events and programmes .
 Participants further noted that to address global warming in their respective countries , they need financial assistance and qualified personnel . In this regard , assistance will be required to carry out national inventories to identify sources and   causes   of greenhouse emissions at the local level . Meeting outcomes and major recommendations
 The right path to combat this dangerous phenomenon is clear and lies in the fulfilment by all parties â developed and developing â of their commitments according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , and not according to the principle of shared responsibilities which some countries are seeking to promote . Needless to say , addressing this phenomenon effectively requires dealing with its   causes   and adapting to its adverse effects , especially when we know that the most affected States , in particular the African countries and the small island developing States , produce the smallest quantities of damaging greenhouse gas emissions and are at the same time the least capable of adapting to the negative impact . In that context , Egypt , as one of the least significant emitters of greenhouse gases , emphasizes the need to address that serious problem from the perspective of the common interest of humanity â and , again , in the proper forum in which all Member States participate â not only from a security perspective , but from the perspective of the three pillars of sustainable development .
 Many of the initiatives and actions highlighted at United Nations global conferences and elsewhere are yielding positive results . The preceding accomplishments suggest there is   cause   for a degree of self-congratulation and an element of optimism . However , there is no room for complacency since past accomplishments have fallen short of what could have been achieved , what needed to be achieved and what the international community committed itself to achieving .
 All factions in Palestine have , therefore , finally agreed to cease all acts of violence and provocation , halt inter-factional fighting and achieve peace among themselves. That is indeed a gratifying and encouraging development . We sincerely hope that all Palestinian brothers , regardless of which faction they belong to , can join hands to preserve the long-term national interests and   cause   , effectively implement the agreement that has been reached to consolidate unity by finding common ground despite existing differences and establish a unity Government as soon as possible , so as to resume peace talks between Palestine and Israel . For that is the only way to bring about a bright future for the just cause of the Palestinian people .
 In fact , a number of reports published by the Secretariat in past years warned that there could be conflicts in some countries that could risk spilling over from one country to another . The question should be posed â what are the   causes   of the proliferation of those conflicts ? Were the warnings not taken seriously ; or was there a lack of resources that prevented the Council from taking up the challenge ?
 There are doubtless some cases in which a girl is compelled to marry someone she does not wish to marry. This occurs in social milieus where social legacies and prevailing customs so permit. Preventing a woman from marrying or compelling her to marry a person whom she does not wish to marry violates Islamic law . The Shariah judiciary in Bahrain allows a young women to file a legal action to compel her father to marry her off to the person whom she wishes to marry and who is appropriate for her if the father refuses to consent to the marriage without reasonable   cause   . Marriage Contract
 Mr. Elsherbini -LRB- Egypt -RRB- said that the international community was at a significant crossroads in the Middle East peace process . The continued refusal of Israel , the occupying Power , not to allow either the Special Committee or the fact-finding mission of the Human Rights Council to enter the Occupied Palestinian Territory was   cause   for increasing concern and was part of Israel 's attempts to prevent both bodies from uncovering the truth about the human-rights situation in the West Bank , Gaza and the Golan . First , the continued occupation itself was a violation of human rights .
 Hundreds of heavily armed policemen had conducted searches of the premises of the organization and members ' houses . Members had been assaulted and arrested without   cause   . Attempts had been made to auction off the land and building of the organization 's headquarters in an attempt to suppress its activities .
 We are well aware that the world of the twenty-first century must not be based on intolerance on any ground . We , the leaders of the United Nations Member States , are entrusted with a great responsibility to make every effort to ensure that all the diversity of this world be comprehended and accepted as the wealth of all , rather than as the   cause   of new divisions . Indeed , dialogue and mutual tolerance must prevail as the basic principles of our mutual relations , both within States and internationally .
 It was suggested that the newly elected Commission should be given the opportunity to revisit its working methods at its upcoming twentieth session . Other delegations cautioned that continuous changes to its rules of procedure   cause   uncertainties for coastal States preparing their submissions . A view was expressed that the Commission should ensure a level of scrutiny of the submissions that is sustainable and ensures a thorough examination of the data and information submitted by the coastal State .
 On the other hand , he also states that the Goals are achievable if existing commitments are met . Looking forward , however , we believe that there is greater   cause   for disquiet than for optimism . That belief is based on the following reasons .
 Item 66 -LRB- b -RRB- of the provisional agenda* New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support :   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa
 What does âestablishedâ and âlong usageâ mean in connection with place-names ? The Act states that such names shall not be changed without good   cause   . How shall âgenerally accepted rules for linguistic correctnessâ be understood ?
 Cluster munitions can cause harm to the civilian population even years after active hostilities have come to an end and the local population tries to build a life in peace . For these reasons , Austria has resolved to strive for a ban on the cluster munitions that   cause   such unacceptable harm , for destruction of the stocks and for a prohibition on the transfer of such munitions . Our goal is to enable swift and efficient clearance of affected areas and to assist the victims of these weapons .
 Putting an end to violence necessarily requires national will and a suitable regional and international environment . It also requires shared determination by the various actors with a view to dealing with the structural   causes   of the conflict . While certain aspects of the peacebuilding process will respond to the specific causes of the conflict , we must bear in mind that there are certain factors common to all post-conflict situations .
 Accurate information on the impact of radiation , drawing on the reassuring findings of the Chernobyl Forum , can go a long way towards easing the fear , confusion and anxiety that plague many residents . Together with that information , advice on healthy lifestyles should be widely disseminated as a means of addressing the   causes   of many ailments mistakenly blamed on the Chernobyl accident . Coordination among the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system should build on the sturdy consensus supporting the development approach and the findings of the Chernobyl Forum .
 Fighting extreme poverty is key to preventing conflict . My progress report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of peace and development in Africa -LRB- A/62/204 -RRB- clearly acknowledges that reality . It is therefore heartening that over the past decade , Africa has made significant progress towards ending armed conflict .
 For this , capacity-building , science and technology and a truly developmental Doha Round are all necessary . I would like now to respond to the report of the Secretary-General on progress regarding the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace in Africa -LRB- A/62/204 -RRB- . The report states that the last few years have witnessed many positive developments in Africa and that the number of armed conflicts has been significantly reduced .
 It calls upon the State party to ensure that public officials , especially law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , health-care providers and social workers , are fully familiar with relevant legal provisions and are sensitized to all forms of violence against women , and that they are capable of providing adequate support to victims . It urges the State party to collect data and to conduct research on the prevalence ,   causes   and consequences of all forms of violence against women , including domestic violence , and to use such data as the basis for further comprehensive measures and targeted intervention . It invites the State party to include statistical data and the results of measures taken in its next periodic report .
 Please provide information on the steps taken to implement the Presidential decree âOn urgent measures regarding the reform of the public health systemâ of 6 December 2005 , as well as on any measures taken to introduce a system of compulsory State social medical insurance . Please provide further information on measures taken to increase the life expectancy rate in the State party which has continuously declined over the past 15 years due to   causes   such as non-communicable diseases caused by malnutrition -LSB- note for Spanish translators : âalimentaciÃ³n adecuadaâ -RSB- , smoking and drug and alcohol abuse , suicide and accidents . Please provide information on measures taken to contain the rapid growth of the HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics in the State party -LRB- see paras. 407-422 of the report -RRB- .
 Each contracting party shall maintain , or institute as soon as practicable , judicial , arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose , inter alia , of the prompt review and correction of administrative action relating to customs matters . Such tribunals or procedures shall be independent of the agencies entrusted with administrative enforcement and their decisions shall be implemented by , and shall govern the practice of , such agencies unless an appeal is lodged with a court or tribunal of superior jurisdiction within the time prescribed for appeals to be lodged by importers ; Provided that the central administration of such agency may take steps to obtain a review of the matter in another proceeding if there is good   cause   to believe that the decision is inconsistent with established principles of law or the actual facts .

 Mr. Mekki Ahmed -LRB- Sudan -RRB- : My delegation aligns itself with the statements by the representative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the representative of Benin on behalf of the African Group . We thank the Secretary-General for his three thorough reports -LRB- A/62/203 , A/62/204 and A/62/321 -RRB- on the items we are discussing today : the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- , the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa . My delegation wants to emphasize agenda item 64 , which concerns NEPAD .
 We believe that such a move would improve accessibility , lower cost and build local capacity for self-reliance and self-sufficiency . I turn to the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . It is no secret that the continent has faced devastating conflicts over the past 20 years .
 â¢ Inquire whether the document is of a type that is regularly issued . â¢ A general addressee , such as âTo whom it may concernâ should be   cause   for further inquiry . â¢ Do not assume the authenticity of letterheads of well-known companies or organizations that could have been produced by laser printer .
 His family and his country have our condolences . Despite continued insecurity in parts of the Central African region , there is   cause   for hope . Since the mission travelled to the Congo , a transitional Government and its administrative arrangements have been established .
 Terrorism in all its manifestations must be condemned and fought relentlessly and globally . While no   cause   justifies unleashing terror upon the innocent , such outrages must make us redouble our efforts to address their root causes and seek political and socio-economic explanations and solutions to them . My Government is firmly committed to the global endeavour to fight terrorism .
 Recommendation 10. The Executive Committee may wish to approve the following : -LRB- a -RRB- The Inspector General position should be a non-career position serving a five-year non-renewable term at the D-2 level , and be appointed by the High Commissioner after consultation with the Executive Committee , and subject to dismissal by the High Commissioner only for   cause   , following similar consultations with the Executive Committee ; -LRB- b -RRB- The Inspector General should submit individual reports to the High Commissioner , but , at the request of the Inspector General , any such report shall be submitted to the Executive Committee together with the High Commissioner 's comments thereon ;
 For one can not challenge allegations without conducting judicial inquiries that are sufficiently thorough and impartial to be credible . In his previous report the independent expert had underlined the importance of âa cooperation strategy that relies more on quality than quantity , and in which priority is given to redressing the balance in favour of â¦ professionals who , through their professionalism , respect for the law and independence of mind , give good   cause   for thinking that they will be players in the futureâ -LRB- ibid. , para . It is they who are paving the way for this long-awaited change which is emerging so slowly .
 He stressed the need to promote better disclosure through the distribution of information on the economic benefits of good corporate governance practices . Following the presentations of the panellists , participants deliberated on implementation issues , such as the gaps that existed between principles or standards and practice ;   causes   of these gaps ; and challenges faced in bridging the gaps . Other specific issues discussed were availability , accessibility and applicability of internationally agreed corporate governance principles ; the gap in implementation at the subsidiary level of a company ; application and implementation of corporate governance practices for SMEs , non-publicly traded companies and state-run enterprises ; and reconciliation of internationally recognized good practices with local culture .
 Where an employee is hospitalized at the orders or under the supervision of the company doctor , the firm will pay the cost of such hospitalization , subsequently recovering 50 per cent of the amount involved by withholding from the employee 's pay after completion of the treatment . A woman employee who has a child may be absent from her work for 14 consecutive weeks , including six weeks following the date of her delivery. Such absence may not be deemed   cause   for termination of her contract of employment . Her absence may be extended for up to three weeks in the event of illness associated with her pregnancy or delivery .
 They include delayed sexual initiation ; postponement of marriage ; abstinence or reduction in sexual relations ; avoidance of breastfeeding by those who are uncertain about their HIV status ; use of condoms instead of or in addition to other contraception ; and a decline in such traditional practices as widow inheritance and polygamy . Awareness of HIV/AIDS and its   causes   might cause individuals to delay the initiation of sexual intercourse or postpone union formation . Trends towards later age at sexual initiation and marriage are evident in many countries , including those where HIV/AIDS prevalence is high -LRB- United Nations , 2003a -RRB- .
 It is simply not true to say that the Serbs or Republika Srpska are the only barriers to reform . We have had   cause   to overcome barriers to reform put up by the other people in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which were equally large . But , the one immediately in front of us , The Hague , is obviously an issue for the Republika Srpska more than for any of the others .
 In a post-conflict situation , national reconciliation , to attain its overriding goal , a peaceful society , necessarily involves telling the truth , which is the basis of justice . This occurs at two levels : first , setting the record straight about the   causes   of conflicts , including the inequalities and denials of rights which caused them , and universal recognition of those imbalances ; secondly , telling the truth about the human rights violations and atrocities committed during the period of hostilities . While the first stage naturally lends itself to reconciliation by calling on the political arena to summon up the will â and create the conditions â to correct previous imbalances , the second does give rise to many questions , since it rejects the idea of impunity in favour of the idea of settling accounts , of punishment , and of reparations due to the victims as well as to moral rehabilitation , all of which increase the chances of lasting reconciliation .
 The new Family Code aims to ensure equality between women and men within the family , including protecting a woman from abuse by her husband when exercising her right to divorce . Mexico reported that 14 out of the 32 States had civil codes where domestic violence was a valid   cause   for divorce , and fewer than half of those codes considered violence against children a valid cause for divorce . Laws to prevent domestic violence existed in 25 of the 31 federal entities .

 While we are grateful to those organizations , we urge them to strengthen their intervention , which forms part both of prevention and of an integrated approach to conflict resolution . We recall that in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- , the Secretary-General had already noted that unless the causes are eliminated , we can not truly put an end to conflict . Among those causes we would stress poverty , which weakens and threatens order , national stability and the security of democratic institutions and thus makes countries vulnerable to armed conflict .
 India has recognized the dual-use character of many of the advances in science and technology . The potential for their use for both civilian and military applications is a legitimate   cause   of concern . However , discriminatory regimes deny access to these crucial technologies to the developing countries , even for peaceful development purposes .
 It should also be noted that market distortions due to market access barriers to the agricultural exports of developing countries and subsidized competition from developed countries can affect rural development in poorer countries by constraining agricultural growth and even reducing agricultural growth as small farm incomes are reduced by decreasing agricultural commodity prices . Indeed , the study commissioned by FAO concluded that the root   cause   of the massive crisis of small farming communities , of rural poverty and hunger in poor agricultural countries lies in the exposure of poorly equipped and unproductive small farming communities to competition from far more productive agricultural systems . Another FAO report has recently concluded that the incidence of external shocks in the form of depressed prices and import surges is expected to rise as agricultural trade is increasingly open , which can further undermine domestic production .
 The workshop provided a forum for further discussing major findings of the IPCC tThird aAssessment rReport and elaborating specific measures to promote public participation in climate change activities in the region . Efforts are under way to raise funds tofor the follow -up of this project by launching that will enable to launch national campaigns in other countries , produceing more graphical and information materials on   causes   and implications of climate change and entering into partnerships with new target population groups . UNEP has continued to support the functioning of the IPCC secretariat .
 I also appreciate the efforts that have been made by the Secretariat in this area , including the ten-point platform it announced and the round-table discussions it has held . As the concrete examples in the report of the Secretary-General -LRB- S/2004/431 -RRB- make clear , the   causes   , the parties and the forms of armed conflict that threaten the safety of civilians vary widely . Today we are witnessing an increasing number of internal conflicts caused by a variety of factors , rather than traditional warfare between States .
 In that regard , it was to be hoped that in the coming years promotion and coordination activities would be stepped up and that the Office of the High Representative -LRB- OHRLLS -RRB- would present the progress achieved for each party concerned under the matrix format of results recommended by the Economic and Social Council -LRB- ECOSOC -RRB- in its resolution 2002/33 . The fact that many of the LDCs ' traditional partners , such as Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway and Sweden had earmarked more than 0.20 per cent of their GDP for development assistance to LDCs , thereby fulfilling the commitments undertaken under paragraph 83 of the BPoA , was a   cause   for satisfaction . Benin was grateful to other partner countries and the international organizations for their constant solidarity and support for LDCs , although no data were yet available regarding the importance of their contributions .
 This is contrary not only to the text and spirit of resolution 1566 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , but also to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee . In resolution 1566 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , the Security Council unanimously endorsed the proposition that the deliberate targeting of civilians is simply unjustifiable by any   cause   . Until everyone accepts this proposition , we shall not see truly universal collaboration against terrorism â indeed , we shall not see the end of terrorim .
 â¢ Those that do not correspond , owing to their nature or volume , with the asset and liability transactions of clients in respect of their professional or commercial activities or their transaction history ; â¢ Those that without due   cause   involve cash deposits by a large number of persons . However , article 23 of the draft bill amending Act No. 1015 , which is due to be presented to National Congress as soon as possible , provides as follows : âentities required to do so must report any act or transaction , irrespective of the amount , where there is an indication or suspicion that it pertains to money- or property-laundering , a related offence , or to terrorism , terrorist acts or terrorist groups.â
 I regret to report that , during the current reporting period , the relative reduction of terrorist attacks was shattered on 29 January by a suicide bombing in Jerusalem that killed 11 and injured at least 50 . We must reiterate our utter condemnation of terrorism. No   cause   can justify such heinous crimes . We urge the Palestinian Authority to take the steps necessary to bring those who plan , facilitate and carry out such attacks to justice .
 Please indicate , as appropriate , how your efforts are coordinated nationally , regionally and/or internationally . According to the provisions set out in the Law on Prevention of the Laundering of the Proceeds from Crime credit institutions and financial institutions shall refrain from conducting a transaction if there is   cause   for suspicion that this transaction is associated with the laundering or attempted laundering of proceeds from crime. Credit institutions and financial institutions have an obligation to : - notify the Control Service without delay regarding each financial transaction the elements of which conform to at least one of the elements included in the list of elements of unusual transactions .
 If the total amount of the financial transaction is not determinable at the time of its performance , the identification of the client shall be conducted as soon as the total amount of the transaction becomes known and it is 10 000 LVL or larger . Irrespective of the amount of the financial transaction , a credit institution or a financial institution shall identify a client if the elements of the transaction conforms to at least one of the elements included in the unusual transaction element list , or also if due to other circumstances , there is   cause   for suspicion regarding the laundering or attempted laundering of proceeds from crime . If a credit institution or a financial institution knows or has cause to suspect , that the transactions mentioned are conducted on behalf of a third person , it shall , insofar as possible , also identify such third person .
 Irrespective of the amount of the financial transaction , a credit institution or a financial institution shall identify a client if the elements of the transaction conforms to at least one of the elements included in the unusual transaction element list , or also if due to other circumstances , there is cause for suspicion regarding the laundering or attempted laundering of proceeds from crime . If a credit institution or a financial institution knows or has   cause   to suspect , that the transactions mentioned are conducted on behalf of a third person , it shall , insofar as possible , also identify such third person . The supervisory and control authorities of credit institutions and financial institutions have a duty to report to the Control Service facts discovered during the course of examinations which conform to the elements which are included in the list of elements of unusual transactions , and regarding which the relevant credit institution or financial institution has not notified the Control Service .
 When any new United Nations peacekeeping operation was established or an existing mandate was extended , paramount importance should be given not only to the consent of the parties but also to the non-use of force except in self-defence , impartiality and the need for clearly defined mandates and secure financing , which were essential to a mission 's success . Although the Non-Aligned Movement continued to regard United Nations peacekeeping as an important instrument for maintaining international peace and security , it could not be a substitute for a permanent solution or for addressing the underlying   causes   of conflicts . Past experience had shown that it was most useful as a temporary measure .
 Consequently , there is no need for urgent legislative measures at this time . Under Libyan law any funds that are unlawful as to their source ,   cause   , purpose or manner of use may be frozen ; therefore any funds used for terrorist acts or other criminal acts may be frozen or seized . The Central Bank updated a number of administrative units and jobs concerned with investigating accounts and reporting , namely :
 Requests the Secretary-General to explore and recommend suitable arrangements and mechanisms through which Member States could more effectively support Africa 's efforts to address the multiple causes of conflict in Africa , including their regional dimensions , and to strengthen , in a coordinated and sustained manner , preventive action as well as post-conflict peacebuilding ; Decides to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ; 2 Requests the Secretary-General to submit a progress report on the implementation of the present resolution to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly .
 This provision reflects the statutory provisions under German law for interim measures granted unjustly by state courts and is an expression of a general principle of law . Thus it was included in the Arbitration Actâaccording to general consensusâfor the sake of clarification and to reiterate the idea that a party seeking interim measures of protection without sufficient   cause   must compensate damages arising therefrom ipso jure , i.e. without an express undertaking to do so . Apart from this provision , there is no further specific statutory provision dealing with the consequences of unjustified interim measures .
 It therefore seems logical that the question whether a company has ceased to exist , and is no longer able to function as a corporate entity , must be determined by the law of the State in which it is incorporated . -LRB- 6 -RRB- The final phrase âfor a reason unrelated to the injuryâ aims to ensure that the State of nationality of the shareholders will not be permitted to bring proceedings in respect of the injury to the corporation that is the   cause   of the corporation 's demise . This , according to Article 10 , is the continuing right of the State of nationality of the corporation .
 The Executive Committee may wish to approve the following -LRB- paragraphs 35 - 36 -RRB- : The IG position should be a non-career position serving a five year non-renewable term at the D-2 level , and be appointed by the High Commissioner after consultation with the Executive Committee , and subject to dismissal by the High Commissioner only for   cause   , following similar consultations with the Executive Committee ; The IG should submit individual reports to the High Commissioner , but , at the request of the IG , any such report shall be submitted to the Executive Committee together with the HC 's comments thereon ; and
 The two â hard and soft threats â are closely connected . After all , we know that the   causes   of war and violence , poverty , need and oppression are multifaceted and deep-rooted . We also know that crises are the fruit of poverty and a sense of hopelessness , and vice-versa .
 Their contribution to the global effort is required so that the Convention can live up to its promise as an instrument designed to end the suffering caused by anti-personnel mines once and for all . However , given the dynamism that has characterized the universalization process of the Convention in the past five years , there is   cause   for optimism for a truly g1obal ban on anti-personnel mines . In this regard , and on the eve of a major anniversary in the life of the Convention , I would like to mention in particular the encouraging and positive developments that we have witnessed in the past few weeks on the Indian subcontinent .
 Special challenges continue to be presented to the Council by the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the situation in Burundi . Those situations call for a sharper focus on the   causes   and antecedents of the conflicts in those countries with a view to ensuring that they are properly addressed and , if possible , rooted out . In all the post-conflict situations in Africa , particularly in West Africa , what stands out in bold relief is the need for appropriate interventions to relaunch economic growth in ways that will have a positive impact on the lives of the people .
 2.8 The author claims that there were a number of procedural irregularities in relation to his arrest and trial . He claims that there was no probable   cause   to detain him , his brother and father on the border , and that their arrest therefore contravened article 221 of the Criminal Procedure Code . He alleges that his initial arrest was confirmed by the relevant authority on 31 December 1997 , five days after his detention , which is well beyond the 72 hour limit imposed by the Criminal Procedure Code .
 4.11 The State party contends that the Spanish Constitution allows the continued use of titles of nobility , but only because it views them as a symbol , devoid of legal or material content , and cites the Constitutional Court to the effect that if use of a title meant âa legal difference in material content , then necessarily the social and legal values of the Constitution would need to be applied to the institution of the nobilityâ . It argues that , admitting the continued existence of a historical institution , discriminatory but lacking in material content , there is no   cause   to update it by applying constitutional principles . Only 11 judgements of the Supreme Court - not adopted unanimously - have departed from the ancient doctrine of the historical rules of succession to titles , as a result of which the question of constitutionality arose , the matter being decided by the judgement of the Constitutional Court of 3 July 1997 .
 He remains in need of a treatment plan to allow him to function properly in Canadian society , and will remain in detention , under psychiatric treatment , until this has been achieved . 3.4 The author 's removal would leave his family , who care deeply for him , without a son and brother and   cause   grief and loss. Maintaining close family ties is particularly important to people of colour , given difficulties in Canadian society . His family , willing and able to support the author in Canada , would be unable to do so in Jamaica .
 The General Assembly in particular , as the most democratic and representative organ of the Organization , is the appropriate framework for defining and developing a comprehensive even-handed strategy and true international cooperation in the fight against terrorism . Only a coordinated , comprehensive and effective response to all types of terrorism , whatever their origin ,   causes   and aims , can free present and future generations from the unforeseeable consequences of a scourge which knows no borders . Today , as never before , it is obvious that neither terrorism nor all the other serious problems that threaten the very survival of humankind can be solved through the use or threat of use of force , because violence simply leads to more violence and intolerance to more intolerance .
 -LRB- h -RRB- Addition of a sentence at the end of paragraph 148 along the following lines : âFor example , where an application to commence insolvency proceedings might otherwise be denied , some insolvency laws provide an exception for individuals with insufficient assets to fund the administration of proceedings , enabling the affairs of that debtor to be investigated to determine if there are assets that can be recovered and whether or not the debtor should receive a dischargeâ ; -LRB- i -RRB- Addition after the first sentence of paragraph 170 of text along the following lines : âWhere the debtor is a natural person , some jurisdictions exclude torts of a personal nature such as defamation , injury to credit or reputation , or personal bodily injury. The debtor remains personally entitled to sue and to retain what is recovered on the basis that the incentive to vindicate wrongdoing otherwise would be diminished , but the debtor not be entitled to sue for any loss of earnings associated with those   causes   of actionâ ; -LRB- j -RRB- Addition after paragraph 181 of text along the following lines , based on paragraph 13 of document A/CN.9/550 , to address the issue of making a security interest effective against a third party : âWith respect to actions to make a security interest effective against third parties , some laws dealing with security interests provide specified time periods within which those security interests should be made effective against third parties , whether by registration , publicity or some other means .
 The scheme of liability is outlined in section 107 of the Superfund Act and financial responsibility for clean-up is outlined in section 108 . âIf any person who is liable for a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance fails without sufficient   cause   to properly provide removal or remedial action upon order of the President pursuant to section 104 or 106 of this Act , such person may be liable to the United States for punitive damages in an amount at least equal to , and not more than three times , the amount of any costs incurred by the Fund as a result of such failure to take proper action . The President is authorized to commence a civil action against any such person to recover the punitive damages , which shall be in addition to any costs recovered from such person pursuant to section 112 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Act .
 During oral hearings in the Nuclear Tests case , in response to a question by the President of the Court , Sir Humphrey Waldock , whether it took the view that âevery transmission by natural causes of chemical or other matter from one State into another State 's territory , airspace or territorial sea automatically created a legal cause of action in international law without the need to establish anything moreâ , Australia asserted that : âwhere , as a result of normal and natural use by one State of its territory , a deposit occurs in the territory of another , the latter has no   cause   of complaint unless it suffers more than nominal harm or damage . The use by a State of its territory for the conduct of atmospheric nuclear tests is not a normal or natural use of its territory .
 â2. To provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by a responsible official in connection with the removal activities ; or â3. Without sufficient   cause   , to comply with an order issued under subsection -LRB- c -RRB- or -LRB- e -RRB- of section 1321 or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.â Furthermore , under subsection 2703 -LRB- b -RRB- , a responsible party is not liable to a claimant to the extent that the incident is caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the claimant .
 -LRB- B -RRB- To provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by a responsible official in connection with removal activities ; or -LRB- C -RRB- Without sufficient   cause   , to comply with an order issued under subsection -LRB- c -RRB- or -LRB- e -RRB- of section 1321 of this title or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.â The limitation of liability provided under section 2714 -LRB- a -RRB- of OPA may also be lost in accordance with section 2714 -LRB- c -RRB- by the wilful misconduct or violation of a safety regulation by an employee of the responsible party or by an independent contractor performing services for the responsible party .
 The United States CERCLA contains , in section 9607 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- , provisions on limitation of liability . The subsection also authorizes the imposition of punitive damages if a liable person fails without sufficient   cause   properly to provide removal or remedial action upon order of the President in an amount at least equal to and not more than three times the amount of costs incurred as a result of the failure to take proper action . As in OPA , the right to limit liability is lost if the defendant fails to cooperate or provide assistance to public officials .
 The same is true of the CRTD and the Basel Protocol . Article 20 of the CRTD and article 21 of the Basel Protocol provide further that non-recognition may exist where the judgement is irreconcilable with an earlier judgement validly pronounced in another Contracting Party with regard to the same   cause   of action and the same parties . Moreover , under the Basel Protocol , where there is an agreement or arrangement in force between the Contracting Parties on mutual recognition and enforcement of judgements under which the judgement would be recognizable and enforceable , the Protocol provisions do not apply .
 -LRB- c -RRB- The decision is irreconcilable with a decision given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which recognition is sought ; -LRB- d -RRB- The decision is irreconcilable with an earlier decision given in another State involving the same   cause   of action and between the same parties , provided that this latter decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the State addressed.â Under paragraph 2 of article 23 , a decision recognized under paragraph 1 which is enforceable in the State of origin shall be enforceable in each State party as soon as the formalities required -LRB- which shall not permit the merits of the case to be reopened -RRB- by the laws of that party have been completed .
 -LRB- b -RRB- Where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present his case ; -LRB- c -RRB- Where the judgement is irreconcilable with an earlier judgement validly pronounced in another Contracting Party with regard to the same   cause   of action and the same parties ; or -LRB- d -RRB- Where the judgement is contrary to the public policy of the Contracting Party in which its recognition is sought .
 Life expectancy is still below 50 years in 36 countries , 33 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa and most of which are affected by HIV/AIDS and/or conflict . In the 53 countries most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic , it is estimated that HIV was the   cause   of nearly 20 million excess deaths by 2000-2005 and that the number of excess deaths will likely rise to 32 million by 2010-2015 , even under the assumption that measures to control the further spread of the disease will be moderately successful . The global infant mortality rate is estimated at 56 deaths per 1 , 000 live births in 2000-2005 , the result of 8 deaths per 1 , 000 live births in the more developed regions and 61 deaths per 1 , 000 live births in the less developed regions .
 On 9 April 1996 , the Cabinet approved a revision of the law regarding the cancellation of the betrothal agreement , claiming compensation in case of unfaithful behavior , and termination of marriage in order to promote equality between women and men . However , several details remain to be discussed by NCWA and other related agencies responsible for drafting the law , particularly appropriate wordings regarding the   cause   of divorce . The NCWA has attempted to work out a compromise and is waiting for the right time to submit the amendment in order to avoid opposition from certain parliamentary members who still adhere to old stereotypes .
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . In its resolution 2004/60 , the Commission reiterated and reaffirmed :
 On that front , the Tribunal has been engaged in several expertise-sharing initiatives with Croatian authorities with a view to preparing the national judicial system for the referral of cases from the ICTY . Therefore , while progress is still needed , there is   cause   for optimism with regard to the potential transfer of cases to certain courts in Croatia that have received â or will have received â special training and resources for the trial of war crimes cases . The likelihood of referring cases to the courts of Serbia and Montenegro is diminished by the poor record of cooperation between that State and the Tribunal in recent months .
 The General Assembly , Recalling the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , and its resolutions 53/92 of 7 December 1998 , 54/234 of 22 December 1999 , 55/217 of 21 December 2000 , 56/37 of 4 December 2001 , 57/296 of 20 December 2002 , 57/337 of 3 July 2003 and 58/235 of 23 December 2003 , as well as resolution 59/213 of 20 December 2004 on cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union , Recalling also , in this context , Security Council resolutions 1325 -LRB- 2000 -RRB- of 31 October 2000 on women and peace and security , and 1366 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- of 30 August 2001 on the role of the Council in the prevention of armed conflicts ,
 Terrorism is a threat to our security ; it creates fear and want , and severely hampers economic and social development . No   cause   , however legitimate , can justify acts of terrorism . The fight against terrorism must continue to be a top priority for the United Nations and the world community .
 Response : -- meeting the long -term needs of many , while supporting the emergency needs of few . When conflicts occur or hazards turn into   cause   disasters , human settlements , people and property always are always among the most affected . Therefore , aAny recovery process , irrespective of its short- or long-term planning horizon , has , therefore , to consider , in addition to meeting urgent human needs , the physical infrastructure and human settlements problems that arise , , including adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .
 Therefore , it was irrelevant , for the purposes of the definition , that the claim should be accompanied by a protest â although that was often the case â containing a request for an investigation into the facts or a proposal for other means of peaceful settlement . What was really relevant was that the State bringing such a claim espoused the   cause   of its nationals and stated as much . Second , as a result of the foregoing , the current language of draft article 1 did not distinguish between âdiplomatic protectionâ proper and other related concepts , such as diplomatic or consular assistance to nationals experiencing difficulties as a result of their detention or trial in another State , a situation where none of the criteria for diplomatic protection proper , such as the exhaustion of local remedies , could be invoked .
 NEPAD bears the hope of the rebirth of the African continent . What Africa needs today is not a diagnosis of the   causes   of underdevelopment or prescriptive advice , but a strong helping hand from the international community to ensure NEPAD 's success , especially through enhanced official development assistance provided without conditionalities , the redemption of pledges to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund and the provision of aid without any strings attached . Zimbabwe greatly appreciates the assistance provided to Africa by the United Nations specialized agencies in the areas of peace and security , poverty alleviation , socio-economic development , governance and infrastructure development .
 It also makes it an offence to receive or provide money or other property in those circumstances . Use and Possession : It is an offence to possess money or other property intending or having reasonable   cause   to suspect that said money or property should or may be used for the purposes of terrorism . Funding Arrangements : It is an offence to enter into , or become concerned in , an arrangement that will or may result in money or other property , which is known or suspected , being made available to another -LRB- or is to be made available to another -RRB- for the purposes of terrorism .
 Islamophobia in this context could well convert the historic failure of Islam-based extremism into an unexpected victory . The desire to confine Islam in a pathological straitjacket and to make it the axis of evil ultimately leads to conferring the stamp of legitimacy on forms of extremism for which Islam has been a pretext rather than a   cause   . At the same time , the world has slipped dangerously towards a logic of war and repression that results in even more violent confrontations and can only fuel and sustain terrorism .

 Here , the greatest similarity is to the freezing of funds . Article 169 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for other precautionary measures : âAside from the cases provided for in the preceding articles , any person having good   cause   to fear that , during the period prior to the judicial recognition of his claim , the latter may suffer imminent or irreparable harm may request such urgent measures as are most appropriate in the circumstances to ensure provisionally the application of the court 's decision.â The above legal framework is sufficient to enable the State to create mechanisms through the Office of the Attorney-General so that precautionary measures in rem can be taken in each particular case .
 Inadequate health education , diagnosis , prevention , treatment , and the necessary resources impact the spread of disease , early mortality , job loss , and social disintegration of the family and nation . Some essential areas that urgently need further global action are the HIV/AIDS pandemic ; morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled communicable diseases especially malaria , tuberculosis , and cholera ; excessively high infant , child &amp; maternal mortality rates , and the lack of potable water and sanitation as a   cause   of disease . These areas especially need to be addressed in developing countries , with a priority focus on Sub-Saharan Africa .
 Such justification , the theory goes , might include self-determination , national liberation or one 's own perception of the will of God . The resolution which we have adopted states very simply that the deliberate massacre of innocents is never justifiable in any   cause   â never . Either terrorism is never justifiable , or it is sometimes justifiable .

 Moreover , environmental degradation may also contribute to social eruption and conflict . The causes and prevention of poverty overlap substantially with the   causes   and prevention of open violence and complex humanitarian emergencies . We may distinguish between short-term and long-term prevention .
 Those wishing to possess pistols , restricted weapons or MSSAs undergo additional vetting processes and may only use these particular firearms under prescribed circumstances . In order to lawfully possess pistols , MSSA firearms and restricted weapons an endorsement on a firearms licence is required. Such endorsements set conditions on possessing these firearms and require the holder to demonstrate specific   cause   to own . Civilian ownership of pistols , MSSA firearms and restricted weapons must be registered .

 One speaker stressed the substantial financial contribution made by the National Committees to UNICEF programmes and their important role in advocacy , communication and education for development . Asked by one delegation about the increased expenses related to uncollected accounts receivable , the Director said that the   cause   for this had been remedied and controls introduced to prevent this in future . Responding to concerns about the declining volume in card sales , he highlighted the Division 's current initiative to counter the decline with the successful launch of an expanded mix of higher-priced gift products .
 Recalling further the creation by the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 2002/1 of 15 July 2002 , of ad hoc advisory groups on African countries emerging from conflict , Reaffirming that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa must remain a priority on the agenda of the United Nations system and the Member States , Noting with concern the slow progress in the implementation of many of the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General , as well as the emergence of trends , that could potentially affect the peace and stability of Africa ,

 Rule 10 In accordance with article 72 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , if a member of the Committee dies or resigns or declares for any other   cause   that he or she can no longer perform his or her duties as a member of the Committee , the Secretary-General shall immediately request the State party that nominated the expert to appoint within two months another expert from among its own nationals for the remaining part of the term . The new appointment is subject to the approval of the Committee .
 Among other improvements in the control of select agents and toxins are the regulatory requirements that those possessing , using , and transferring select agents and toxins must meet minimum established standards for biosafety , physical security , training , and record keeping . Another proactive feature of U.S. law involves the authority provided to the Attorney General to apply to a court for authorization to seize biological agents , toxins , or delivery systems if there is probable   cause   to believe that they would be used as a weapon . In an emergency , the Attorney General may act without a court order .
 Generally speaking , however , Section 22 of the Societies Ordinance -LRB- Chap. 151 -RRB- should be applicable to recruitment to terrorist bodies . Moreover , in May 2003 the Government of the Special Administrative Region submitted to the Legislative Council a revised draft of the United Nations -LRB- Anti-Terrorism Measures -RRB- Ordinance -LRB- Chapter 575 -RRB- for 2003 , of which a new Section 10 provides that any person who is aware that , or has reasonable   cause   to believe that , a given group is a listed terrorist group , may not recruit another person to become a member of that group . Thus recruitment of members of a terrorist organization is a criminal offence , regardless of the method used to carry out the recruitment .
 Have we fulfilled our commitments ? If so , today we have   cause   to celebrate 10 years of progress . If not , and I am afraid that is the case , the 10-year commemoration offers us the opportunity and the challenge to identifying the constraints that have led to our failure and the new strategies we intend to deploy in order to meet our commitments .
 The convention imposed on contracting States a number of duties with the aim of encouraging the freest possible movement of foreign correspondents in the exercise of their functions . The draft convention on freedom of information was premised on the belief that free interchange of information and opinions in the national and the international sphere is a fundamental human right , as well as being essential in the   cause   of peace and for political/economic progress . The main duty on contracting States was the obligation , set in article 1 , that each State secure to all its nationals and to the nationals of every other contracting State lawfully within its territory , freedom to impart and receive information and opinions , orally , by written or printed matter , in the form of art , or by legally operated visual or auditory devices without governmental interference .
 Interlocutory appeals from decisions of Trial Chambers generally arise pursuant to four specific rules : -LRB- a -RRB- rule 65 requests for provisional release ; -LRB- b -RRB- rule 72 decisions on preliminary motions ; -LRB- c -RRB- rule 73 decisions on other motions ; and -LRB- d -RRB- rule 108 bis on state requests for review . Sub-rule 65 -LRB- D -RRB- provides that any Trial Chamber decision under rule 65 on provisional release shall be subject to appeal in cases where leave is granted by a bench of three judges of the Appeals Chamber , upon good   cause   being shown . Trial Chamber decisions under rule 72 involving a challenge to jurisdiction under sub-rule 72 -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- may be appealed to the full Appeals Chamber , provided that a bench of three judges of the Appeals Chamber , pursuant to rule 72 -LRB- E -RRB- , decides that the appeal is from a decision on a motion challenging jurisdiction as defined by rule 72 -LRB- D -RRB- .
 On 22 , 23 and 24 September 2003 , respectively , Fatmir Limaj , Haradin Bala and Isak Musliu pursuant to rule 65 applied for leave to appeal three separate decisions of the Trial Chamber , which had rejected their requests for provisional release . The three accused were all seeking leave to appeal arguing good   cause   pursuant to rule 65 -LRB- D -RRB- . The three accused argued inter alia that the Trial Chamber had erred in : not granting them an oral hearing ; failing to inform the parties of its decision ; and not placing the burden of proof on the prosecution to demonstrate that the accused were not entitled to provisional release .
 Messrs. Bala and Musliu also argued that the Trial Chamber had erred in concluding that , owing to the seriousness of the charges against them they would flee and likely not appear for trial . On 31 October 2003 , a bench of the Appeals Chamber which comprised of Judges Schomburg -LRB- presiding -RRB- , GÃ¼ney and Weinberg de Roca held that none of the appellants had demonstrated that the Trial Chamber might have erred in the exercise of its powers under rule 65 -LRB- B -RRB- and that within the meaning of rule 65 -LRB- D -RRB- , no good   cause   had been shown . Leave to appeal was thus denied in all three cases .
 Additional challenges include the limited capacity on the part of the National Transitional Government of Liberia to provide social services and consolidate State authority , the disputes among the former armed factions regarding the distribution of government posts , and the delays in the passage of the electoral reform bill . While investigations into the   causes   of the October disturbances continue , reports indicate that a land dispute may have triggered the initial rioting , which rapidly assumed ethnic and religious dimensions involving members of the predominantly Mandingo ethnic group . At the same time , the situation was also repeatedly exploited for their own ends by disgruntled combatants awaiting reintegration , loyalists of former President Charles Taylor and some elements of the opposing factions within LURD .
 Nonetheless , wage differences persist between men and women , along with market segmentation in terms of labour supply . The Labour Code introduces amendments that improve the rights of female domestic workers -LRB- and also male domestic workers although they are a minority in this sector -RRB- , incorporating the rights to holiday bonuses , pre- and post-maternity leave , and the right to receive severance pay , while removing references to morality and honour as a   cause   for justified dismissal . Nonetheless , instances of discrimination remain in the Labour Code , which particularly affect this sector of female workers -LRB- which accounts for one quarter of the female EAP -RRB- , in relation to pay , length of the working day , recognition of overtime , weekly rest period and conditions for contract termination .
 The network encompasses Anglophone Africa , Francophone Africa , South Asia , South East Asia , Latin America , the Caribbean and the Pacific . DAWN 's aims and purposes are to examine the economic , social , cultural and political processes which   cause   and perpetuate inequalities of gender , class and race ; to analyse development strategies and their impact on women and the poor , through a feminist perspective ; and to seek development alternatives for sustainable and gender just development , through research , analyses , training , advocacy , and communication activities . DAWN influences debates on global development issues by offering holistic analyses from a South feminist perspective that is both grounded in women 's experience and inspired by women 's collective strategies and visions .
 In other words , better planning for transition in the countries concerned must be based on the development of a unified , coherent strategy for the entire United Nations system and of a permanent support mechanism for United Nations country teams . My Government supports the efforts of the Secretary-General for Africa and the appeal to implement his recommendations contained in his 1998 report on the   causes   of conflicts and the promotion of sustainable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- . We must work , above all , to strengthen our Organization by supporting the Secretary-General 's initiatives and innovative and courageous activities which are forward-looking in terms of reforming the main bodies of the United Nations .
 the identity , whereabouts and activities of persons in respect of whom reasonable suspicion exists that they engage in terrorism or are members of a terrorist organization ; the movement of funds linked to persons who engage in terrorism or are members of a terrorist organization . Furthermore , Section 22 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act authorizes any law enforcement or customs officials of the Marshall Islands may seize and , in accordance with this section detain , any funds , that the officer or official has probable   cause   to believe were derived from or intended for terrorism , including , without limitation , funds being imported into or exported from the Marshall Islands . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Funds of , or intended for , terrorist organizations shall be frozen , seized , and in accordance with this section detained , where the organization has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council .
 Undemocratic institutions and policies were promoting economic colonization , and the right to development of the developing countries was being violated . While there was much talk of poverty eradication , little was being done to address its   causes   . The United Nations must fulfil its development mandate or else the current âglobalismâ , like terrorism , communism and imperialism , would lead to injustice , oppression and death .
 Experience since 1992 with the delegation of authority in such matters directly from the Office of Human Resources Management to personnel sections of established field missions demonstrates that this is a legitimate concern . Furthermore , such inconsistencies may be a   cause   for appeals to the Joint Appeals Board by staff members who defend their claims against a perceived discretionary administrative decision based on personal interpretation by the processor of the claim .

 âThe Office of the Procurator General of the Nation has responsibility and consultative activities for the state organs and entities.â The provision goes on to specify that the Attorney-General will be appointed by the President and can be removed by him for a duly established just   cause   . The post must be occupied by a lawyer belonging to the Bar and have the âsame qualities corresponding to a magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justiceâ .
 Thirdly , the need for us to agree on the objective that we hope to attain from the dialogue among civilizations . After all , it is an attempt to understand each other , to explain ourselves to the other , to bring about coexistence between civilizations and to remove any   cause   of conflict and confrontation between them . Fourthly , the need to stop pointing fingers at others and condemning their ideas or slighting their beliefs or trying to impose on them what we think is correct .
 Large-scale confrontation , which often arises from religious , ethnic and racial intolerance , has also been fed by economic aspirations , the search for living space and the conquest of new colonial empires , which in turn gives rise to further confrontations legitimately based on the aspirations of peoples to freedom and independence . Such confrontation will continue until the   causes   disappear â that is , until there is true solidarity between peoples and we are convinced of the need to accept diversity and to respect each other despite our differences . Given its geographic location , my country has always been at the crossroads of major civilizations .
 Sanctions might leave armed youths unaffected and in a position where they are even unable to appreciate , or are indifferent to , the wider consequences of their actions . The underlying   causes   of inter-group tensions in Solomon Islands and the events which followed the attempted civilian armed coup in Fiji could be difficult to identify , and are beyond influence by sanctions . It is , therefore , vital that serious difficulties such as those currently affecting Fiji and Solomon Islands be properly studied and carefully addressed .
 In these studies , the range of outcomes attributable to tobacco has included cancers , and heart and lung disease , categories previously described only in developed countries . In addition , recent studies have pointed to the importance of tobacco as an important   cause   of tuberculosis death : recent epidemiological studies in China show a significant increase in the risk of contracting tuberculosis . In different regions of the world , the tobacco epidemic has taken on different profiles .
 The report builds on the earlier reports of the Secretary-General on Africa , makes a candid analysis of the causes of conflict in Africa and offers approaches to confront conflict and achieve durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . I wish also to commend the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa . The Ad Hoc Working Group represents an important step towards the implementation of the Secretary-General 's recommendations on the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa .
 It is only right that the Millennium Declaration , in its part VII , should address the issue of meeting the special needs of Africa , on which international peace and security depend . In the report that he submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly in 1998 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , the Secretary-General made a certain number of recommendations . It is encouraging to note that the Millennium Summit endorsed his main recommendations and that the participants in the Summit shared the Secretary-General 's opinion that , in order to achieve lasting peace and development , we need an integrated approach to security that takes into account the promotion of peace , poverty eradication , development and democracy .
 Mr. Ben Mustapha -LRB- Tunisia -RRB- -LRB- spoke in Arabic -RRB- : Allow me at the outset to express to the delegations of Singapore and Angola our deep sorrow and condolences for the two airplane crashes in which many people lost their lives . My delegation would also like to thank and commend the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa for the comprehensive and useful report now under consideration . That report assumes great importance for us Africans in view of the reality that many countries in the African continent are experiencing tension and conflict and in light of the level of the continent 's development , which all agree is not up to the new international level , especially in the new millennium that we all hope will be one of harmony , international solidarity , security and stability .
 While we theorize on the risks and benefits of globalization , the marginalization of the African continent is becoming increasingly globalized . It is against the backdrop of these observations that our debate on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa must take place . Today , many ordinary Africans are asking if the world really cares about the fate of Africa .
 By applying to the United Nations , just as the other four successor States did previously , the new authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have confirmed that they accept the principle of the equality of all the States that emerged after the dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This step is a good start for the new authorities , and is   cause   for optimism that they will depart from other failed policies of the Milosevic regime by respecting the borders and territorial integrity of neighbouring States , protecting human and minority rights , consistent with international standards , and cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , as well as by respecting the legal equality of the five successor States in negotiations on all succession issues . By doing so , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will make a valuable contribution to good-neighbourly relations , peace and lasting stability in South-East Europe .
 In addition , the Superintendence of Banks is part of an International Commission that analyses and studies the problem and issues pertinent observations related to proposals for legal reform , with a view to the specialization of the control of the activities that are presumed illicit or at least irregular . An Inter-Institutional Committee within the Commission carries out field work and implements the various measures needed , with the participation of the State , trying to obviate the need for further analysis in initiating criminal   causes   . There is interest in combating corruption , and there are workshops that devise ways to harmonize the norms and limit the scope of action of groups involved in these types of crimes that utilize different mechanisms with state-of-the-art technology , especially regarding financial illicit acts .
 The rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty -LRB- CTBT -RRB- has not been reversed . Under these circumstances we believe that there is no   cause   for the euphoria generated by the consensus arrived at during the NPT Review Conference . We are not convinced that a credible process of step-by-step nuclear disarmament is likely to be initiated in the near future , and the prospects for the elimination of nuclear weapons remain remote , if not Utopian .
 The third point is this . I think we all recognize now that we can not deal with these problems of security and conflict without dealing with the   causes   of conflict too . Whether it is poverty , debt , aid and development , infectious diseases or Governments and the rule of law , we need a far broader concept of how we deal with these security issues for today 's world .
 It is a description of diplomatic protection as the term is understood in the language of international law . âOn the basis of nationality of natural or legal persons , States claim , as against other States , the right to espouse their   cause   and act for their benefit when they have suffered injury and/or a denial of justice in another State . In this respect , diplomatic protection has been defined by international jurisprudence as a right of the State â¦â
 He wondered what kind of global economy allows 50 million children to work worldwide and why the vulnerability of children should be exploited . He proposed that eradication within the next 10 years of the worst forms of child labour should be made a worldwide   cause   . Fifty-fifth session

 Decision 21/I Exceptional reports6 The Committee decided that it may sometimes be necessary to request exceptional reports from States parties , under article 18.1 -LRB- b -RRB- of the Convention , in order to obtain and examine the information on an actual or potential violation of women 's human rights , where there is special   cause   for concern about such violation . -LRB- a -RRB- There should be reliable and adequate information indicating grave or systematic violations of women 's human rights ;
 It is now more complex than in the past to maintain international peace and security . Nonetheless , this should not be   cause   for paralysis ; on the contrary , it should create greater impetus. General Dwight Eisenhower once said : âEvery gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed .
 Mr. Minoves-Triquell -LRB- Andorra -RRB- said that Andorra , a country without a Ministry of Defence , an army or missiles , had lived in peace and neutrality for 700 years , yet it had become clear that , in the twenty-first century , neither isolation nor neutrality was a guarantee of peace . Since it had joined the United Nations in 1993 , Andorra had been actively involved in the   cause   of disarmament and had provided whatever assistance it could in that area . Although Andorra had no military structures or nuclear installations , it had wished to join the moral stand against nuclear proliferation , and had signed the NPT and the CTBT in 1996 .
 Aware of the widespread support for the revitalization of the Regional Centre and the important role that the Centre can play in the present context in promoting confidence-building and arms-limitation measures at the regional level , thereby promoting progress in the area of sustainable development , Taking into account the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Taking into account the need to establish close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity , in conformity with the relevant decision adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-fifth ordinary session , held at Algiers from 12 to 14 July 1999 ,
 Subject to sub-rule 2 , an appeal against a decision of conviction or acquittal under article 74 , a sentence under article 76 or a reparation order under article 75 may be filed not later than 30 days from the date on which the party filing the appeal is notified of the decision , the sentence or the reparation order . The Appeals Chamber may extend the time limit set out in sub-rule 1 , for good   cause   , upon the application of the party seeking to file the appeal . The appeal shall be filed with the Registrar .
 We share the view that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is one of many symptoms of increased intra-State conflicts since the end of the cold war . Although the accumulation and illegal circulation of small arms and light weapons does not in itself   cause   conflict , their excessive accumulation has exacerbated internal conflicts , complicated peace-building and undermined peace agreements in many countries , including my own . In numerous countries , especially in those affected by separatist movements , stocks are stolen for use by paramilitaries or sold off along with illegally produced armaments in other zones of conflict .
 It also notes and encourages the ongoing cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross . It encourages the Government of Colombia to seek effective means to eradicate the   causes   of displacement , in particular by ensuring visible operational results in the struggle against paramilitary groups and others forcing displacement , and bringing those responsible to justice . âThe Commission welcomes the cooperation extended by the Government of Colombia to the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons and encourages the Government of Colombia to follow up on his recommendations .
 The representative of Bolivia expressed the hope that the identification process would move forward without delay within the time limits set for the holding of the referendum . The recent outbreak of violence , which had resulted in deaths and injuries among the civilian population , gave   cause   for concern . The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania said his delegation was seriously concerned over the situation in Western Sahara , and hoped that the appeals process would be handled expeditiously and the difficulties would be resolved to enable the scheduled referendum to be held .

This imbalance needs to be rectified ; -LRB- c -RRB- Declining terms of trade   cause   debt ; -LRB- d -RRB- Goods valuation means that Northern goods -LRB- such as Coca Cola -RRB- can have sharply rising prices but Southern products -LRB- such as oil -RRB- come under attack .
 the Magistrate may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a police officer to enter the premises specified in the warrant at any time within 24 hours after the issue of the warrant and , subject to any conditions specified in the warrant , to take such action as is necessary to prevent the commission or repetition of the offence or a breach of the peace or to protect life or property . Section 23 of the Act provides that a police officer may exercise his power to enter premises and arrest without a warrant where he has reasonable   cause   to believe that a person is engaging in , or attempting to engage in , conduct which amounts to physical violence and failure to act immediately may result in serious physical injury or death . However , where a police officer exercises a power of entry under this section he is required to immediately submit a written report to the Commissioner of Police , through the head of the division where the incident occurred .

 With respect to the interception of mail , a new Postal Corporation Act , 1999 is now in effect . Section 47 of the Act provides that any person who without reasonable   cause   or excuse , opens or causes to be opened any postal article which is not addressed to that person , commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of TT $ 5 , 000 or imprisonment for six months . Section 46 makes it obligatory for a person who comes into possession of a postal article not addressed to him or her to return it to the Trinidad and Tobago Post for delivery .
 For us in Nigeria , the experience of the immediate past and the realities of today demonstrate quite clearly that there is no alternative to democracy if the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are to be respected . The Nigerian delegation shares the views expressed by the Secretary-General on the links between democratization , political rights , economic freedoms and development in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We fully subscribe to the idea , expressed in the Vienna Declaration , that democracy , development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing ; their promotion and sustenance translate into an effective conflict prevention strategy .
 The Representative was requested to prepare a comprehensive study identifying existing laws and mechanisms for the protection of internally displaced persons , additional measures to strengthen implementation of these , and alternatives for addressing protection needs not adequately covered by existing instruments . The mandate of the Representative since has been renewed three times -LRB- resolutions 1993/95 , 1995/57 and 1998/50 -RRB- and the Representative has been requested to continue his analysis of the   causes   of internal displacement , the needs of those displaced , measures of prevention and ways to strengthen protection , assistance and solutions for the internally displaced . The Representative is requested to do so through dialogue with Governments , intergovernmental , regional and non-governmental organizations , and by taking into account specific situations .
 This has occurred in the context of the Council 's focus this past year on the issue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict . With armed conflict being the principal   cause   of internal displacement and protection the most critical need of the populations affected , the plight of the internally displaced proved to be a key concern raised in the consideration of this theme . The Statement by the President of the Security Council -LRB- S/PRST/1999/6 -RRB- , made after the Council 's first consideration of the issue in February 1999 , expressly referred to internally displaced persons as among the vulnerable groups of civilians .
 Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ; Reaffirms that the   causes   of poverty should be addressed in an integrated way , taking into account the importance of sectoral strategies in such areas as education , development of human resources , health , human settlements , rural development , productive employment , population , environment , freshwater , food security and migration , and the specific needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , in such a way as to increase opportunities and choices for people living in poverty and to enable them to build and to strengthen their assets so as to achieve social and economic development ; Also stresses the importance of increasing access to and control by the poor over resources , including land , skills , knowledge , capital and social connections , and of improving access for all to basic social services ;
 Particularly relevant were information and analysis provided in these reports on the areas of education , health , governance , information technology , population and gender , trade access and opportunities , economic diversification , regional cooperation and integration , water , food security , environment and South-South cooperation . Also relevant in the context of the preparation of this progress report was the report submitted in 1999 to the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly -LRB- A/54/133-E/1999/79 -RRB- on , inter alia , the implementation of the recommendations contained in the 1998 Secretary-General 's report to the Security Council and the Assembly on âThe   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ . Information provided by the organizations of the United Nations system in the context of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on Africa established to monitor the implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations was also useful in the preparation of this report .
 On both fronts , I can assure this Assembly that Africa is not a hopeless continent , as some of our detractors would have the world believe . The Secretary-General 's seminal report on the   causes   of conflict in Africa has not fallen on deaf ears . Our continent has been changing for the better for some time now .
 This adversely affects the peace and security of the entire neighbourhood , from West to Central Asia to South Asia . The negatives that emanate from the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan , in the shape of terrorism , drug trafficking and the flow of arms ,   cause   justifiable concern all over the world . The Taliban and their mentor must heed the world 's demands and abandon the path of conflict .
 The Government reported that national statistics do not give accurate and detailed information about the incidence or prevalence of domestic violence or child neglect , and crime statistics concerning violence do not include specific information about perpetrators , victims or whether violent acts took place in public or private places . Child welfare statistics giving information about the registered   causes   for intervention concerning children use categories such as neglect and physical abuse , and some children who witness domestic violence can be categorized as having been mentally abused . The legal structure for dealing with child abuse and neglect is provided through the Norwegian Child Welfare Act , which imposes no formal limits as regards who may report a case of assumed child neglect or abuse to the municipal child welfare services .
 A child is defined as being in need if he or she is unlikely to achieve or maintain or to have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision for him or her of services by a local authority -LRB- Sect. 17 -LRB- 10 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- or if his or her health or development is likely to be significantly impaired or further impaired without the provision of such services , or if he or she is disabled . The local authorities are required to make enquiries where they have reasonable   cause   to suspect that a child is suffering , or is likely to suffer , significant harm , and a court may make a care order or an emergency protection order based on the findings of such enquiries . In August 1999 , the Home Office published a draft new guidance entitled âWorking together to safeguard childrenâ , which takes into account new research , experience and legislation concerning child abuse .
 Welcoming also the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as the coordination centre for all United Nations activities concerning small arms , Thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement on small arms made by the President of the Security Council on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations made at the meetings of the States of the subregion held at Banjul , Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,

 The Domestic Violence Act , 1999 was enacted to replace the Domestic Violence Act , 1991 with the aim of ensuring a prompt and equitable legal remedy for victims of domestic violence . Section 23 of the new Act gives a police officer the power to enter private premises without a warrant where he has reasonable   cause   to believe that a person is engaging in conduct which amounts to physical violence and failure to act immediately may result in physical injury or death . The Legal Aid and Advice -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Act , 1999 was enacted recently to amend the existing legal aid scheme .
 On the pretext that the world Organization must not interfere in the Oslo process , any initiative on its part thus risks being blocked in the Security Council . However , a good opportunity has just been missed with the proposal of President Arafat , which could have given the Palestinian side   cause   for hope . That confidence-building measure would have defused tension between the Israeli and Palestinian communities and enabled the international fact-finding committee to carry out its mission properly .
 This is even truer when we consider the close connection in developing countries between deeply rooted economic and social problems and the outbreak of conflicts . The Secretary-General 's seminal report on the   causes   of conflicts in Africa underlines this critical nexus . We need to assure greater continuity between political and military action and the economic and social reconstruction , without which there can be no peaceful international pull out .
 Too often , the Security Council decides on quick fixes rather than developing well-thought-out strategies to restore peace in conflict areas . Too often , it prefers to address the symptoms of conflict rather than its root   causes   . Too often , it fails to implement its own resolutions .
 Iran had made progress in promoting and protecting human rights , and that progress had been recognized by the Special Rapporteur in his interim report . In all cases , the   cause   of human rights could be served only by dialogue and cooperation . Any other approach would jeopardize progress .
 This concept is reflected in the preamble to the draft resolution , wherein the General Assembly would reaffirm the close linkage between peace , security and development and the need for a comprehensive implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General , contained in his report in document A/52/871 . The report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , contained in document A/55/45 , pointed to the lack of political will as one of the major obstacles to the implementation of those recommendations . Thus , in the preamble to the draft resolution , the General Assembly would emphasize the need to strengthen further the political will that is indispensable for the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General and the proposals of the Working Group .

 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . -LRB- See also para. 23 above .
 Decision to hold the confirmation hearing in the absence of the person concerned After holding consultations under rules 123 and 124 , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall decide whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges in the absence of the person concerned , and in that case , whether the person may be represented by counsel . The Pre-Trial Chamber shall , when appropriate , set a date for the hearing and make the date public .
 Subject to sub-rule 2 , an appeal against a decision of conviction or acquittal under article 74 , a sentence under article 76 or a reparation order under article 75 may be filed not later than 30 days from the date on which the party filing the appeal is notified of the decision , the sentence or the reparation order . The Appeals Chamber may extend the time limit set out in sub-rule 1 , for good   cause   , upon the application of the party seeking to file the appeal .

 The Assembly decided to conclude its consideration of agenda item 30 .  Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa : draft resolution -LRB- A/55/ L.37/Rev.1 and Corr.1 -RRB- The General Assembly resumed its consideration of agenda item 50 .
 Indeed , I recognize that internal factors have contributed to the low achievement in social development in Africa , but the world needs to focus more attention on ensuring that the external environment is pro-social development . It is my hope and vision that this special session will provide a new impetus towards the elimination of obstacles that have prevented the full attainment of the   cause   of Copenhagen . It is not my intention to place blame on the international economic system , but merely to state possible areas of action for further initiatives to make Copenhagen a reality not only for us , but also for our children and their children after them .
 The infant mortality rate dropped from 86 to 82 per thousand in the same period . While these few statistics are   cause   for cautious optimism , we remain convinced that the task ahead is enormous . Burkina Faso reiterates its will and commitment to implementing the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and , to that end , urges all its development partners to release additional resources for sustainable development .
 The Protection of Personal Liberty Act was enacted for the purpose of recovering speedily and easily by judicial trial the liberty of a person who has been unjustly violated . Those who are detained without adequate   cause   may claim relief to a high court or a district court . In addition , anyone may make an appeal on behalf of the detained person .

 Aware of the widespread support for the revitalization of the Regional Centre and the important role that the Centre can play in the present context in promoting confidence-building and arms-limitation measures at the regional level , thereby promoting progress in the area of sustainable development , Taking into account the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , 7 Bearing in mind the efforts undertaken in the framework of the revitalization of the activities of the Regional Centre for the mobilization of the resources necessary for its operational costs ,
 -LRB- Note : Text to be drafted .

 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa , and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa ,
 Since the consent to be bound by a treaty and the consent to a unilateral commitment were both expressions of the will of State , it seemed logical that the same reasons for invalidity should apply to both types of statements â Undoubtedly , a unilateral act is impugnable , as is a treaty , if the expression of will is vitiated by flaws . Clearly , the special nature of unilateral acts and the evolution of international relations and international law open up the possibility of including a   cause   not provided for in the corresponding article of the Vienna Convention of 1969 , such as one concerning the infringement of a decision of the Security Council by a unilateral act , a question that will be addressed below . When former draft article 7 was considered in the Commission , some members stated that it was preferable in any event to distinguish between the causes of invalidity and to draft separate articles , following the structure of the Vienna Convention of 1969 â a question that is not being considered here , as it is believed to be more of a drafting question .

In re-examining each of the causes included in the draft article , we refer in the first place to paragraph 1 , on error , about which it was stated in the Commission that it could not be applied in the same way as in the law of treaties. It was stated that an error of fact should be easier to correct than an error committed by a State in adopting the text of a treaty .
 As is well known , error has been the subject of consideration by the international tribunals , particularly the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice , in several cases , such as the Eastern Greenland , Temple of Preah Vihear and Mavrommatis cases , to name a few . The question that arises is whether the   cause   of invalidity based on error â referring , of course , to the substance and not to the expression of consent â applies to unilateral acts on the same terms as in the law of treaties . If unilateral error is possible in a treaty context , there seems to be no reason to deny that it might also be considered in the context of unilateral acts .
 Some doubts were expressed with regard to fraud , referred to in paragraph 2 of former article 7 , on the consideration that âthis provision might encroach on certain accepted ways whereby States led their foreign policy and convinced other States to join in that policyâ . It was deemed appropriate to retain this   cause   of invalidity , which is applied in the context of the law of treaties , on the consideration that the general practice of States does not exactly appear to be one of inducing other States to assume certain obligations based on deceit . Policies differ , of course , but a statement to that effect does not conform to reality .
 âThat , however , was a case of non-disclosure of a material map by the United States in circumstances in which it was difficult to say that there was any legal duty to disclose it , and Great Britain did not assert that the non-disclosure amounted to fraudâ . It was considered , however , that this   cause   should be retained in the draft articles . Paragraph 3 retains the reference to corruption of the person formulating a unilateral act on behalf of a State .
 The practice relating to coercion of the representative of a State in negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty is well known . The   cause   of invalidity relating to the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which is restated in article 52 of the Vienna Convention of 1969 , has also been retained . As is well known , resort to force , which was accepted in eras preceding the League of Nations , is prohibited by international law â mainly since the Kellogg-Briand Pact , on which the Charter of the United Nations is based â as confirmed by subsequent resolutions and declarations , such as the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes , which has now been corroborated by international doctrine as a whole .
 One member of the Commission stated at the previous session that such a norm should be applied more flexibly in the case of unilateral acts . The question that arises is how such a provision can be made more flexible. The wording of a rule based on this   cause   of invalidity can not be distinct from the Vienna wording , which was the result of an intense process of negotiations , notwithstanding the fact that , as noted above , such peremptory norms were not defined in the Convention . Endeavouring to make them more flexible could reopen the debate on a question that continues to be controversial in international law and that should be retained as drafted for the time being .
 In paragraph 7 of former article 7 reference is made to the invalidity of a unilateral act formulated in clear violation of a norm of fundamental importance to the domestic law of the State which formulates it . This   cause   would be closely related to the authorization of the person who formulates the act , a question to which we referred above . An act formulated by an unauthorized person would be invalid unless it is subsequently confirmed by the State .
 Another question that arose at the most recent session of the Commission had to do with the invalidity of a unilateral act that conflicts with a resolution of the Security Council , particularly in the context of Chapter VII of the Charter , a question that was addressed by other members of the Commission and by some representatives in the Sixth Committee . The suggestion by one member of the Commission that under the   causes   of invalidity , mention should be made of the fact that a unilateral act may conflict with a decision of the Security Council appeared to be very apt . The member of the Commission then stated that âarticle 7 should include Security Council resolutions among the factors that could be invoked to invalidate a unilateral act .
 That view was reiterated by a representative in the Sixth Committee , who stated that âunilateral acts formulated in violation of a Security Council resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter , should be invalidâ . For this reason it was deemed appropriate to include in the draft article on invalidity of unilateral acts a   cause   relating to their conflict with a resolution , or rather , a decision of the Security Council â a term that we consider more appropriate because of its legal significance â a view that was also expressed by a member of the Commission , who referred last year to âanother cause of invalidity , namely , conflict between a unilateral act and decisions of the Security Council . Clearly , what was intended were binding decisions of that body â .
 That view was reiterated by a representative in the Sixth Committee , who stated that âunilateral acts formulated in violation of a Security Council resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter , should be invalidâ . For this reason it was deemed appropriate to include in the draft article on invalidity of unilateral acts a cause relating to their conflict with a resolution , or rather , a decision of the Security Council â a term that we consider more appropriate because of its legal significance â a view that was also expressed by a member of the Commission , who referred last year to âanother   cause   of invalidity , namely , conflict between a unilateral act and decisions of the Security Council . Clearly , what was intended were binding decisions of that body â .
 This act marks an important milestone in the formulation of the international law of the sea , and while it was not consistent with a pre-existing customary norm , it had a decisive influence on the formulation of a new norm when States accepted it and it was later reflected in the conventions on the law of the sea . It was not deemed appropriate to include a norm along these lines as a   cause   of invalidity because , in fact , such an act , which conflicts with a norm of general international law , is not invalid if the States concerned or affected agree that , while it is not consistent with existing general international law , it is part of the process of formulating a new customary norm , and that the norm was not rejected by States and did not give rise to protest . New draft article 5 : Invalidity of unilateral acts
 These emissions can result in freshwater acidification and eutrophication , forest dieback , high surface ozone levels , the accumulation of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in soil , water and living organisms as well as associated human health problems . Despite increasing industrialization and reliance on transportation , reductions have been achieved in emissions that   cause   acid deposition and tropospheric ozone . In industrialized countries , the trend is towards continuous efforts to reduce the environmental impacts due to transboundary atmospheric pollution .
 The third argument that was put forward by colleagues who have expressed doubts about the resolution concerned its humanitarian implications . Previous speakers have already discussed how the major   cause   of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan , aside from the drought , is the war . Tens of thousands of Afghans are fleeing this war and the Taliban 's most flagrant violations of human rights , which are also causing suffering in the Afghan population .
 Such separatist moves by the Taiwan authorities are the source of tension in the Taiwan Straits . And the paper submitted by the above-mentioned handful of countries will serve only to add fuel to the separatist moves of the Taiwan authorities , undermine the lofty   cause   of China 's reunification and jeopardize peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large . The Chinese Government firmly opposes this .
 At this historic juncture , it would be timely for the General Assembly to ask the Secretary-General to explore ways and means of enhancing an already advanced cooperation in order to meet the challenges , old and new , of the third millennium . Since both the Council and the United Nations place human dignity at the centre of their missions and mandates , stronger working links between them can only aid in the achievement of their noble   cause   .

 Such a ruling may be granted once a cause of action specified in the Halacha is shown to exist . Such   causes   of action include : adultery , refusal to engage in conjugal relations and , in certain cases , where the couple is incapable of having children . However , even where the rabbinical court rules in favour of granting a divorce , the marriage is not dissolved simply by the court 's order .

 Letter dated 15 May 2000 from the Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council On instructions of my Government , I have the honour to forward herewith , the text of a broadcast message to the nation by the President of Sierra Leone , Mr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , in which , inter alia , he told RUF field commanders that the   cause   for which they had been fighting was lost , and appealed to them to release all United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone -LRB- UNAMSIL -RRB- peacekeepers illegally detained by the RUF -LRB- see annex -RRB- . I should be grateful if the present letter and its annex message could be issued as a document of the Security Council .
 We appeal to them to lay down their arms , now . I would like to let anyone who has access to these RUF field commanders and their combatants , to let them know , by radio , by word of mouth , or by whatever means of communication at their disposal , that the   cause   for which the RUF had been fighting is lost . I repeat , lost , lost forever .
 Agenda item 50  Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Nigeria : draft resolution
 Nigeria : draft resolution  Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa The General Assembly ,
 What occurred at Qana in April 1996 was deeply tragic , incurring the loss of life and significant damage to property . The   cause   of this incident , however , was tragic as well . The cause was the cynical tactics of the terrorist organization , Hezbollah , which used civilians as human shields for its attacks .
 Subsequently , the final review was postponed to the year 2002 . In paragraph 3 of its resolution 54/234 of 22 December 1999 entitled âThe   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ , the General Assembly welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council to hold a high-level segment on Africa in 2001 . Elements to be considered in selecting the theme
 Its only criteria was need . Nevertheless , certain contributions were earmarked by donors for specific   causes   , which led to some refugees receiving more assistance than others . The Office of the High Commissioner urged donors not to earmark their contributions thus enabling the agency to utilize them equitably .
 Welcoming also the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as the coordination centre for all United Nations activities concerning small arms , Thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement on small arms made by the President of the Security Council on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations made at the meeting of the States of the subregion held at Banjul , Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,
 Ms. Contamin -LRB- France -RRB- introduced draft resolution A/C.3/55/L.52 on behalf of the sponsors , joined by Canada and Morocco . There was greater   cause   than ever for concern about enforced disappearances , which amounted to nothing less than a form of organized repression . The draft resolution stressed the importance of combating impunity and welcomed , in particular , the fact that enforced disappearances had been brought within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as crimes against humanity .
 In the new version , he had inserted an important cause of invalidity based on a comment that a member of the Commission had made the previous year on the invalidity of an act that conflicted with a decision adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter on the maintenance of international peace and security . Although the Council could also adopt decisions under Chapter VI on the establishment of commissions of enquiry , the   cause   of invalidity related solely to Security Council decisions adopted under Chapter VII . Summary of the debate
 A number of comments had been made about estoppel and silence . While there was perhaps little   cause   to include them in the materials on the formulation of unilateral acts , he believed they had to be covered in the context of State conduct and should therefore be included in Part II , on the legal effects of acts . In response to the question whether any pattern could be discerned from the replies of Governments to the questionnaire -LRB- document A/CN.4/511 -RRB- the Special Rapporteur said that some of the replies had been critical of the treatment of the topic .
 Furthermore , this poverty is being made worse , in particular by the rapid spread of AIDS , another scourge that has ravaged , brought suffering to , divided and decimated entire families in Africa and throughout the world . In some African countries , AIDS has even become the main   cause   of death . These are factors for destabilization .
 Welcoming the establishment by the Secretary-General , at the initiative of the States members of the Economic Community of Central African States , of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa on 28 May 1992 , pursuant to resolution 46/37 B of 6 December 1991 , and recalling its subsequent resolutions on the programme of work of the Committee , Bearing in mind the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa and resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- pertaining thereto , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , Bearing in mind the United Nations Millennium Declaration , adopted on 8 September 2000 by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations , and especially chapter VII thereof ,
 â6. Other matters.â During the four meetings held during its first session , the Working Group held a general exchange of views on how to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . For this purpose , the Working Group requested that relevant information be provided by various departments of the United Nations Secretariat , United Nations organizations and programmes , and specialized agencies .
 Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- a -RRB- Report of the Open-Ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa -LRB- A/55/45 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- Note by the Secretary-General -LRB- A/55/431 -RRB-
 My delegation is also pleased at the important campaign undertaken by the United Nations Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- and its Executive Director to end the use of child soldiers , protect children from the effects of sanctions and to draw up special codes of conduct on the rights of the child for all civilian , military and peacekeeping personnel . It is true , as Mrs. GraÃ§a Machel noted in her 1996 report on the impact of armed conflict on children , that armed conflicts   cause   more deaths and injuries among children than among military personnel . According to available statistics , since the beginning of the 1990s over 2 million children have been killed and over 6 million have been wounded or maimed in the course of armed conflicts .

 E. Environmental sanitation and health As a result of the rapid urbanization and increasing industrialization in developing countries , the neglect of solid waste and sewage is the   cause   of major health problems . The comprehensive assessment of the freshwater resources of the world , submitted to the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , in June 1997 , through the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fifth session , reported that in developing countries as much as 90 per cent of waste water is discharged without treatment .
 For the working group 's decision to be conclusive , the decision must be unanimous . It is implicit in this procedure that the working group members would not disagree with the chairperson or rapporteur without good   cause   . The chairperson or rapporteur would first discuss her preliminary conclusion with other members of the working group , then prepare a draft decision for circulation .
 When a warrant of arrest or summons to appear in accordance with article 58 , paragraph 7 , has been issued for a person by the Pre-Trial Chamber and the person is arrested or served with the summons , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that the person is notified of the provisions of article 61 , paragraph 2 . The Pre-Trial Chamber may hold consultations with the Prosecutor , at the request of the latter or on its own initiative , in order to determine whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges under the conditions set forth in article 61 , paragraph 2 -LRB- b -RRB- . When the person concerned has a counsel known to the Court , the consultations shall be held in the presence of the counsel unless the Pre-Trial Chamber decides otherwise .
 Decision to hold the confirmation hearing in the absence of the person concerned After holding consultations under rules 123 and 124 , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall decide whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges in the absence of the person concerned , and in that case , whether the person may be represented by counsel . The Pre-Trial Chamber shall , when appropriate , set a date for the hearing and make the date public .
 Subject to sub-rule 2 , an appeal against a decision of conviction or acquittal under article 74 , a sentence under article 76 or a reparation order under article 75 may be filed not later than 30 days from the date on which the party filing the appeal is notified of the decision , the sentence or the reparation order . The Appeals Chamber may extend the time limit set out in sub-rule 1 , for good   cause   , upon the application of the party seeking to file the appeal . The appeal shall be filed with the Registrar .
 Transport and sustainable development The ability to transport goods and services is a prerequisite for economic growth and development and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- of most countries , but emissions associated with vehicle use   cause   environmental and health problems in many of the world 's major cities and contribute to global environmental problems . More than 95 per cent of the fuel used in the transport sector is petroleum-based , and its emissions contribute to global levels of greenhouse gases , most notably carbon dioxide -LRB- CO2 -RRB- , as well as local pollutants , such as lead , fine particulate matter -LRB- PM -RRB- , nitrogen oxides -LRB- NOx -RRB- and sulphur oxides -LRB- SOx -RRB- .
 The questions of indebtedness , poverty and the shortfall of official development assistance -LRB- ODA -RRB- , as well as disease â in particular , malaria and AIDS â all represent abnormal obstacles that prevent the attainment of the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the continent to development and progress . Despite the fact that the challenges of development and people 's failure to realize their aspirations are considered one of the most salient   causes   of conflict and wars in Africa , we should not ignore the historical origins of these crises and the negative role played by many of the past imperial forces in sowing the seeds of conflict among the newly independent States just before their independence , whether because of the way they delineated the borders of these States or by fomenting tribal and ethnic strife among and between the States of the continent . I recall these facts so that we do not find ourselves supporting the repeated claims that the African people bear the original responsibility for their wars and conflicts , that what is usually called the tribal nature of these people is to blame or , simplistically , that the crisis of development and the causes of conflict in Africa stem from the tribal circumstances of the African people or the absence of so-called good governance in some African States .
 We hope in this respect that the United Nations will take seriously the events that have recently intensified on the borders between Guinea and Sierra Leone and Liberia and address them decisively and quickly , since they presage a new regional conflict in the continent whose repercussions we can not anticipate if the international community should fail to stem the crisis early . More than two and a half years ago , in April 1998 , the Secretary-General issued a report on the   causes   of conflict in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- . There is no doubt that the African continent has since witnessed many of the developments referred to in the report regarding peace and security in the continent , peacekeeping , peacemaking , post-conflict peace-building and creating basic infrastructure to prevent the resumption of conflicts in Africa in the future .
 We hope that these recommendations and all other initiatives will be considered in depth at the intergovernmental event on financing for development , to be held in 2001 , in which Africa intends to take a very active part . The Ad Hoc Working Group has identified a number of obstacles to the speedy implementation of the Secretary-General 's recommendations in his report -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . These obstacles have to do with , inter alia , the general public health situation. In this regard , we agree that if there is one area where there has been a dramatic deterioration in the situation since the publication of the report of the Secretary-General , it is the incidence of HIV/AIDS and its impact on Africa 's future .
 We would also like to convey to all the bereaved families in the other countries affected by the tragic accident that took the lives of their nationals . My delegation welcomes the opportunity this morning to address this important agenda item 50 , the important item on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . Malaysia is gratified that following the report of the Secretary-General on Africa of April 1998 , there has been a tremendous amount of work done by the various organs and bodies of the Organization to address this issue .
 The Millennium Summit pronounced itself strongly on African issues , and we hope that this pronouncement will also find expression in the outcome of the forthcoming high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development . Mr. Cappagli -LRB- Argentina -RRB- -LRB- spoke in Spanish -RRB- : I should like first to express the gratitude of the delegation of Argentina to the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , Foreign Minister Gurirab of Namibia , and the two Vice-Chairmen , Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore and Ambassador Arias of Spain , for their hard work during the three sessions of the Working Group this year and for the complete and well-balanced report submitted for the Assembly 's consideration . We agree with the fundamental premise of the report regarding the relationship between peace and development .
 The Committee has served as a preferred forum for political consultations among government representatives of the States of the subregion . Its work has made it possible to conduct continuing high-level consultations and promote the elaboration and adoption of important confidence-building measures , strengthened by the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . It is in this context that the Heads of State and Government of the States members of ECCAS , at the end of the ninth regular session of the Community , held on 24 June 1999 in Malabo , decided to revitalize the activities of the Community , notably by providing it with adequate financial and human resources .
 In order to keep or create peace in Africa , the United Nations capability for conflict prevention , peaceful resolution of disputes , peacekeeping , post-conflict peace-building and reconstruction must be further strengthened . In this regard , my delegation welcomes the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa . Secondly , new avenues need to be explored for mobilizing additional resources and promoting exports of African countries .
 In addition , substantial reform is required to improve the aid delivery mechanism for greater effectiveness . As has been articulated in the Secretary-General 's report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- , the principles of ownership , participation , partnership and decentralization need to be further developed to ensure that they are anchored in the recipients ' socio-political process . For Africa to effectively embark on the path of sustainable development , it is necessary for the international community to take fast , deep and broad debt relief initiatives , including outright debt cancellation .
 It was agreed at the plenary that the two additional judges shall be drawn from the pool of existing ICTR judges. and they will serve in The Hague as members of the ICTR and ICTY Appeals Chamber . Many of the logistical and administrative difficulties that were highlighted in the past as   causes   of delay in the progress of trials have been and are being addressed by the judges and the Registrar . The judges continue to stress that the focal point for the administration of services and resources should be the judicial functions of the Tribunal .
 The Panel notes that in paragraph 6 of decision 9 -LRB- S/AC.26/1992/9 -RRB- , the Governing Council set out guidelines for awarding compensation for business losses caused by Iraq 's invasion and occupation of Kuwait where the trade embargo and related measures were also a cause . In decision 9 the Governing Council stated : âCompensation will be provided to the extent that Iraq 's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait constituted a   cause   of direct loss , damage or injury which is separate and distinct from the trade embargo and related measuresâ . The Panel finds that Eteco did not demonstrate that its contract losses directly resulted from Iraq 's invasion and occupation of Kuwait .

 In some countries , only 30 per cent of children are vaccinated . Even fewer children have access to the recently licensed and expensive vaccines that are likely to have a huge impact on reducing child mortality -LRB- such as the vaccine against rotavirus , a   cause   of diarrhoea -RRB- . Developing new methods for sustainable vaccine delivery would not only benefit the poorest of the poor , but would be a prime issue around which to leverage additional resources .
 Informal consultations Informal consultations with interested delegations on agenda items 30 -LRB- Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s , including measures and recommendations agreed upon at its mid-term review -RRB- and 50 -LRB-   Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -RRB- will be held on Monday , 27 November 2000 , from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in Conference Room 9 . Informal consultations with interested delegations on a draft resolution on humanitarian assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , under agenda item 20 -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- Special economic assistance to individual countries or regions -RRB- , organized by the delegation of the Russian Federation , will be held on Monday , 27 November 2000 , from 1.45 p.m. to 2.45 p.m. in Conference Room C .
 More than 60 nations represented in this Hall have achieved independence and joined the United Nations as sovereign States in the four decades since the Declaration was adopted . While there is good   cause   for celebration , there is also a need for awareness of the challenges ahead , as the United Nations faces the task of completing the implementation of the Declaration and all the relevant resolutions of the Organization on decolonization . âDuring the past decade , the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has played an important role in maintaining a spotlight on the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories , not least in providing a forum for their peoples to voice their thoughts and aspirations regarding their future .
 When a warrant of arrest or summons to appear in accordance with article 58 , paragraph 7 , has been issued for a person by the Pre-Trial Chamber and the person is arrested or served with the summons , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that the person is notified of the provisions of article 61 , paragraph 2 . The Pre-Trial Chamber may hold consultations with the Prosecutor , at the request of the latter or on its own initiative , in order to determine whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges under the conditions set forth in article 61 , paragraph 2 -LRB- b -RRB- . When the person concerned has a counsel known to the Court , the consultations shall be held in the presence of the counsel unless the Pre-Trial Chamber decides otherwise .
 Decision to hold the confirmation hearing in the absence of the person concerned After holding consultations under rules 5.20 and 5.21 , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall decide whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges in the absence of the person concerned , and in that case , whether the person may be represented by counsel . The Pre-Trial Chamber shall , when appropriate , set a date for the hearing and make the date public .
 Also at stake is peace and security in South Asia , which today is the most volatile region in the world . The root   cause   of all problems afflicting this region , with serious implications for global peace and security , is the unresolved dispute of Jammu and Kashmir . Peace in this region is contingent upon a just settlement of this dispute , which concerns the destiny of 10 million people .
 In that context , national expertise should be utilized more fully and programmes should be more demand-driven in order to meet developing countries ' needs . Mr. Ji Fusheng -LRB- China -RRB- noted with appreciation that , in recent years , the activities of the United Nations University had been more closely linked with those of other United Nations organs , and had provided helpful services to the Secretary-General and Member States , inter alia , by helping to increase understanding of the serious problems facing developing countries and the   causes   thereof . Within the context of the University 's seminars , courses and educational programmes to strengthen capacity-building in developing countries , he had attended courses of the UNU International Institute for Software Technology -LRB- UNU/IIST -RRB- , which were conducted in countries marginalized by the globalization process .
 c -RRB- Children who have been handed over to the child welfare service by persons not entitled to give consent to their adoption ; d -RRB- Children whose parents have been stripped of parental authority , have died , or who , having completely renounced the child for a year , have given   cause   for a court declaration of abandonment . The children entrusted to the child welfare department , but whose parents have retained parental authority over them , are not wards of State .
 The question of amnesty or immunity for example , was not new . Article 15 of the 1996 Abidjan Accord stated , and I quote : âTo consolidate the peace and promote the   cause   of national reconciliation , the Government of Sierra Leone shall ensure that no official or judicial action is taken against any member of the RUF/SL in respect of anything done by them in pursuit of their objectives as members of that organization up to the time of the signing of this Agreement â Unquote . In other words , three years later , Mr. Sankoh and the RUF were given a second chance , indeed a reprieve .
 That Advisory Opinion constitutes a solid doctrinal base which must not be ignored . In reviewing the elements of the Court 's Advisory Opinion , it is clear that â because the devastating and wide-ranging effects of the use of nuclear weapons   cause   incalculable damage to mankind â the Advisory Opinion links questions concerning disarmament law and humanitarian law . Furthermore , according to international law â inter alia , the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations â the international community has a peremptory obligation to maintain peace and security , and to meet this obligation any use or threat of use of such arms must be prohibited .
 Despite talk of the global village , it is apparent that Africa 's lonely days are not yet over . For we still have   cause   and occasion to feel marginalized in so many respects . We know what it is like to give passage to emergency aircraft and sea vessels that criss-cross our airspace and waterways to attend to emerging crises in distant places while our own crises simmer on and explode in our faces .
 -LRB- c -RRB- Should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal ; -LRB- d -RRB- Might be removed by the Secretary-General only for   cause   and with the approval of the General Assembly . In light of the provisions of the resolution mentioned above , the Secretary-General proposes to appoint Mr. Dileep Nair -LRB- Singapore -RRB- as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services for one fixed term of five years , effective 24 April 2000 .
 Secondly , the countries concerned should shoulder the primary responsibility for addressing the needs of women and girls in post-conflict situations and comprehensively implement resolution 1325 -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . Armed conflicts in different parts of the world vary in   cause   and nature. The Governments and people of the countries concerned have the best understanding of the needs of local women and girls . Post-conflict countries are often faced with numerous tasks and difficulties .
 The drivers of the financial and economic crisis are complex and multifaceted . We recognize that many of the main   causes   of the crisis are linked to systemic fragilities and imbalances that contributed to the inadequate functioning of the global economy . Major underlying factors in the current situation included inconsistent and insufficiently coordinated macroeconomic policies and inadequate structural reforms , which led to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes .
 -LRB- a -RRB- The head of OIOS , the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services , is appointed by the Secretary-General following consultations with Member States approved by the General Assembly , and serves one fixed term of five years without the possibility of renewal .

 The fire was put out before it could spread . The white phosphorus wedges continued to burn on the ground in the school compound for several minutes , releasing a white smoke that later would be determined by doctors to be the   cause   of some of the injuries among the victims . Some staff at the school tried to put out the fires with water , creating noxious fumes which could themselves cause long-term harm to health .
 In this regard , some delegations pointed out the necessity to distinguish between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of people in the exercise of their right to self-determination by people under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination . Some other delegations underlined that no   cause   can justify terrorism , and it was further stated that the comprehensive convention should not exclude criminal acts on the basis of self-determination . The inclusion of the notion of âState terrorismâ was also raised out by some delegations .
 Right to social security and to an adequate standard of living While noting comprehensive development and poverty reduction strategies , CEDAW was concerned that widespread poverty among women , as well as poor socio-economic conditions were among the   causes   of the violation of women 's human rights and discrimination against women . It also noted with concern that discriminatory practices with regard to land ownership , administration of property and inheritance , limited women 's access to economic resources , as well as credit and loan facilities .
 It is noted that one recommendation may have more than one cause or more than one functional area . The analysis for 2008 audit recommendations consists of 581 recommendations that can be analyzed by importance , 632 by   cause   , and 588 recommendations can be analyzed by frequency of occurrence in a functional area . The number of recommendations significantly increased in 2008 , from 115 to 581 recommendations -LRB- 505 per cent -RRB- .
 The role of civil society in the eradication of poverty at the grass-roots level Ingrid Srinath , Secretary-General of CIVICUS , commented that State policies that exclude the marginalized segment of society from the enjoyment of its rights are often the   cause   of poverty . In her view , civil society exists as an amplifier of marginalized voices .
 The Human Rights Committee has also raised its concern about parliamentary control over disciplinary procedures of judges and about the dismissal of judges by the executive , e.g. before the expiry of the term for which they have been appointed , without specific legal and procedural safeguards . The Special Rapporteur has expressed his concern with regard to the Judicial Commission of the Supreme Court of Venezuela which can remove judges at its discretion without neither a justified   cause   nor disciplinary proceedings guaranteeing the fairness of the dismissal . In this context , it is vital to note that the Human Rights Committee highlighted the importance of the existence of an independent body or mechanism with the responsibility of disciplining judges .
 Israel continues to impose a policy of oppressing civilian Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan . It continues to imprison them with no due   cause   and to subject them to situations that could jeopardize their lives . We would like to call attention here to the case of prisoner Bashir Al Moqt .
 Ten years have passed since the submission to the Council of the first report of the Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in armed conflict -LRB- S/1999/957 -RRB- , and two years have passed since the adoption of resolution 1674 -LRB- 2006 -RRB- ; we would like to commend Mr. Holmes for his statement on this subject . We hope that today 's debate will lead to an objective vision on ways and means to protect civilians and , above all , to eliminate the   causes   of conflict , because , as they say , it is better to prevent than to treat . We note with concern that civilians are not only victims of violence , flight and displacement , but are also victims of the latest technologies of death , including cluster bombs and phosphorus bombs , which has shocked the international community .
 Removal of a child from the care of the family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should be , whenever possible , temporary and for the shortest possible duration . Removal decisions should be regularly reviewed and the child 's return to parental care , once the original   causes   of removal have been resolved or have disappeared , should be in the child 's best interests , in keeping with the assessment foreseen in paragraph 48 below . Financial and material poverty , or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty , should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from parental care , for receiving a child into alternative care , or for preventing his/her reintegration , but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to the family .
 Peacekeeping operations need to evolve towards a more comprehensive approach to the peace and security problems that they face . Such an approach must not only address the immediate   causes   of the conflicts but , as previous speakers have noted , contribute effectively to developing coherent and consistent action on the part of international community that , in turn , make it possible to establish conditions conducive to sustainable peace and security â in other words , an effective peacebuilding process . Strengthening military adviser teams would promote strategic planning that takes all the elements involved in implementing a peacekeeping operation into account and ensures that they will achieve the desired results .
 Obstacles to obtaining justice undoubtedly reinforce poverty and exclusion . Poverty can thus be seen as both the   cause   and consequence of exclusion from the rule of law . Legal empowerment can give poor people and communities the legal tools to proactively protect themselves from the effects of climate change , such as droughts , deforestation , desertification , sea-level rise and flooding .
 The Special Adviser also met with Laurent Nkunda , then leader of the National Congress for the Defense of the People , an armed opposition group , and a spokesman of the Forces dÃ©mocratiques de libÃ©ration de Rwanda . From his meetings and observations , the Special Adviser concluded that there was   cause   for deep concern regarding the grave human rights and humanitarian situation in North Kivu , including the risk of genocidal violence , with implications for the entire subregion . Extreme ethnic polarization and hatred have become associated with the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
 Furthermore , the FSM Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act prohibits the acquisition , possession or use of property , knowing , or having reason to believe that it is derived directly or indirectly from acts or omissions that would constitute a serious offense . The Act further authorizes the government to seize and detain any currency that is being imported into or exported from the FSM if there is probable   cause   to believe that it was derived from a serious offense , or is intended by any person for use in the commission of a serious offense . The term âserious offenseâ is defined as the violation of any law of the FSM , or its states or political subdivisions , which is punishable by more than a year of imprisonment , or any law of a foreign state in relation to acts or omissions that , had they occurred in the FSM , would have constituted a serious offense punishable by more than one year of imprisonment .
 In this connection , another important safeguard for lawyers which should be emphasized is that âLawyers shall enjoy civil and penal immunity for relevant statements made in good faith in written or oral pleadings or in their professional appearances before a court , tribunal or other legal or administrative authority.â By 1998 , Param Cumaraswamy had already concluded that âIdentifying lawyers with their clients ' causes , unless there is evidence to that effect , could be construed as intimidating and harassing the lawyers concernedâ , and emphasized that âwhere there is evidence of lawyers identifying with their clients '   causes   , it is incumbent on the Government to refer the complaints to the appropriate disciplinary body of the legal profession.â The Special Rapporteur and other mandate holders have expressed serious concerns about cases in which lawyers were put under pressure and ran the risk of reprisals or even prosecution after denouncing ill-treatment suffered by their clients or malfunctions in the system of justice .
 AI noted that under section 3 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Newspapers Act , the Minister of Human Affairs has the sole discretionary power to grant or deny annual publishing permits to newspapers , and that his decisions are not subject to appeal or judicial review . Publishing without a license can result in a fine or three years in jail , and authorities have powers to shut down newspapers without showing   cause   . Section 7 of the Act , AI noted , allows the Minister of Home Affairs to charge printers , publisher , editors and writers who âmaliciously published any false newsâ with a crime punishable by a fine , three years in jail , or both .
 Armed conflicts are characterized by their changing nature , which involves a multiplicity of factors , requiring , in turn , an integral approach . The parties involved , the Security Council , the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Council , as well as other organs of the system within their respective fields of competence , must develop prevention strategies to safeguard peace and protect civilians , dealing with the underlying   causes   of armed conflicts : poverty , external intervention by international corporations , desire for domination on the part of some countries , and so forth . Our State has had the responsibility of protecting civilians displaced by the internal conflict being experienced by our Colombian neighbours and have received them as brothers and sisters and as though they were citizens of our country .
 Moreover , the Tampere definition includes a reference to the causal element of disasters , in order to underscore that the definition covers both man-made and natural events . Reference to causation in the definition of âdisasterâ may fail to consider the problem of complex causation â that is , the problem that one condition can hardly be described as being the only and sufficient   cause   of a given consequence . This obstacle seems of crucial importance today more than ever , when natural phenomena merge with human agency in the complex birth and expansion of disastrous events .

 In other areas , the number of reported casualties has remained stable despite strenuous clearance and mine-risk education efforts . In Afghanistan , the influx of returnees who are unfamiliar with their surroundings , coupled with the impact of poverty and scrap metal collection , is the   cause   of most civilian casualties . In this context , the United Nations provides support to the Government to develop its capacity and strengthen its response to persons with disabilities .
 Removal of a child from the care of the family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should be , whenever possible , temporary and for the shortest possible duration . Removal decisions should be regularly reviewed and the child 's return to parental care , once the original   causes   of removal have been resolved or have disappeared , should be in the child 's best interests , in keeping with the assessment foreseen in paragraph 48 below .

 The Working Group may wish to consider whether the additions of the words âof telecommunicationâ after the word âmeansâ would appropriately cover all existing and future means of communication and whether the words âvideoconferenceâ should be kept in brackets as an example thereof -LRB- A/CN.9/669 , paras . 65-67 and 84 -RRB- . The Working Group may wish to consider whether a provision should be added to address the situation where a party failed to appear at a hearing without showing sufficient   cause   . Annex
 -LRB- d -RRB- The working group for the preparation of a third edition of the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts held its third session in Rome from 26 to 29 May 2008 and its fourth session also in Rome from 25 to 29 May 2009 . The Working Group had been considering a draft chapter on the unwinding of failed contracts , a draft chapter on illegality , a draft chapter on plurality of obligors and/or of obligees , a draft chapter on conditional obligations and a position paper with draft provisions on the termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   . -LRB- e -RRB- An additional area of work under the overall umbrella of the Cape Town Convention was the preparation of a draft protocol on matters specific to space assets .
 On another front , the provision requiring employers to put in place measures that prevent sexual harassment is only applicable to workplaces with more than 25 employees . Failure to recognise taking time off to care for sick family members as good   cause   for absenteeism from work . Given that women spend 9 hours on care labor activities , this therefore inevitably means that women in employment face the risk of having their wages reduced or foregone altogether when they take time off to look after sick relatives .
 Ms. Mambetali -LRB- Kyrgyzstan -RRB- , responding to the question on conformity of the nationality legislation to article 9 of the Convention , said that the general rule was that a child born in the territory of Kyrgyzstan was a citizen of the country and enjoyed its legal protection . He or she could not be extradited or deported to another country or stripped of his or her nationality without due   cause   . Only in the event of disputes arising from the fact that one parent was a citizen of another country or when both parents were foreign nationals or stateless persons did the need for agreement between the two parents arise .
 In accordance with the request made by the Executive Board in decision 2006/13 , the same approach has been followed in the present report . Further refinements have been made in the linkages between risks , deficiency category and   causes   and in the statistical design of the risk model -LRB- annex 1 : Risk groups and descriptions , in document DP/FPA/2008/11 , provides an overview of the risk linkages -RRB- . From 2005 , DOS established its own risk model as a basis for preparing the annual plan of oversight engagements .
 The White Schengen list for our citizens would certainly strengthen the European idea within Bosnia and Herzegovina and provide incentives to the forces that are unequivocally committed to those processes . The goal of our adoption of these laws is to send a clear message to Brussels that we are resolute , which gives us due   cause   to expect that the visa regime will be liberalized by the end of this year or possibly early next year . I hereby wish to urge Council members to encourage the European Commission to expedite its procedures and thus further strengthen the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina .
 Ambassador Inzko 's report rightly highlights a bright spot that has been seen since our last meeting â the enactment in March of the first amendment to the Dayton Constitution to protect the multi-ethnic nature of the Brcko District . The efforts that led to that amendment , which grew out of the Prud process , offer some   cause   for optimism , but while moving ahead with additional reforms . We hope that this initiative will translate as quickly as possible into actions that meet the outstanding 5+2 requirements set by the Peace Implementation Council .
 Young people , as vocal and enthusiastic environmental campaigners , should especially be targeted . Mr. Adam Kimbisa , Mayor of Dar es Salaam , said that it was difficult to separate   causes   and symptoms in a multifaceted crisis , but that there was no doubt that the poor would suffer . Developing countries had made little contribution to climate change compared to developed nations , but consequences such as migration to cities from rural areas rendered unproductive by climate change and the consequent challenges of rapid and uncontrolled urban growth , transport , infrastructure , health , education and inadequate housing were being borne by Africa .
 If effective policy responses are not implemented in a timely fashion , unemployment rates could rise to double digits in some developed countries , and tens of millions of people in developing countries could become unemployed , while hundreds of millions of people could join the ranks of the working poor . The forthcoming United Nations conference at the highest level on the world financial and economic crisis and its impact on development will provide a useful opportunity to take stock of the   causes   of the crisis , consider existing policy responses and necessary reforms , and catalyse further concerted action . The scale of the crisis implies the need for considered efforts to ensure that the already substantial impact of the crisis on the real economies of Member States is not matched by an extensive humanitarian disaster for the world 's most vulnerable .
 In this regard , some delegations pointed out the necessity to distinguish between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of people in the exercise of their right to self-determination by people under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination . Some other delegations underlined that no   cause   can justify terrorism , and it was further stated that the comprehensive convention should not exclude criminal acts on the basis of self-determination . The inclusion of the notion of âState terrorismâ was also raised out by some delegations .
 Delegations affirmed their commitment to remaining engaged in the negotiating process and to reaching agreement on the draft convention by consensus , emphasizing that every effort should be made to resolve the outstanding issues . Some delegations stressed that no   cause   or grievance justified terrorism in any form ; the essential character of the draft convention as an international criminal law instrument , as well as the need to ensure that it should not change existing obligations of States under international humanitarian law or create new ones . While reiterating preferred positions , delegations expressed their readiness to consider the 2007 package proposal of the Coordinator , with some noting that it was a sound basis for reaching a consensus and any possible consideration of previous proposals would represent a step backwards in the negotiations .

 According to the Act , they can file a complaint requesting redress with the Labor Relations Commission within three months , and the Commission should issue a redress order to the employers when it finds the given treatment discriminatory after investigation and inquiry . The Minister of Labor imposes a maximum of 100 million won in fines to those who do not comply with a redress order confirmed through administrative litigation without justifiable   causes   . The discrimination redress system under both Acts is meaningful , as it helps draw social attention to discrimination against non-regular workers and prompts companies to voluntarily endeavor to improve the working conditions of non-regular workers .
 Targeting innocent civilians and thus creating a state of fear or terror in the minds of the general public , is one of the most horrifying criminal acts and can not be tolerated by the international community . No   cause   can ever justify such cowardly and murderous acts . Terrorism undermines everything it claims to be fighting for .
 Such an act is rejected by all religions and all norms and customs . The Islamic religion , in particular , considers that when one kills a person without just   cause   , thus corrupting the Earth , it is as if one had killed all the people of the world . He who gives life gives life to all people of the world .
 We underscore the need for all parties to armed conflicts to abide scrupulously by this principle and for States and the international community to remain especially vigilant during periods of armed conflict and continue to combat all forms of racial discrimination ; -LRB- Adopted by the 3rd PrepCom -RRB- We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other   causes   , to gross violations of human rights , including those arising from racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and from lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ; -LRB- Adopted by the WG of the 3rd PrepCom -RRB- We express our concern that in some States political and legal structures or institutions , some of which were inherited and persist today , do not correspond to the multi-ethnic , pluricultural and plurilingual characteristics of the population and , in many cases , constitute an important factor of discrimination in the exclusion of indigenous peoples ; -LRB- Adopted by the 3rd PrepCom -RRB-
 In the next eight weeks , two important review conferences on global arms treaties will be held in Geneva , relating to the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention . These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and   cause   suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent . The Second Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons -LRB- CCW -RRB- will convene in Geneva on 11 December .
 Nevertheless , he argued that migration is an integral , and increasingly important component of discrimination in the Asia-Pacific region . Racism was both a   cause   and a consequence of migration . He stated that throughout the history of Asia , the movements of people -LRB- through expansion , warfare and trade -RRB- had always resulted in discrimination .
 Kyrgyzstan does not now have these resources available , nor will it even in the long term . This is not Kyrgyzstan 's fault , but a great misfortune that has befallen it and has both objective and subjective   causes   . Unfortunately , God bypassed Kyrgyzstan in that He did not place in its soil either oil or gas , and this now condemns our people to experience incredible difficulties in their daily lives .
 It was also noted that the success of the programme was dependent on the level of support given to it . The view was expressed that activities within the Division for Palestinian Rights did not constitute an appropriate use of scarce United Nations resources , since they did nothing to advance the   cause   of reaching a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , and in fact complicated the search for a negotiated outcome . It was also expressed that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories was not only biased but also duplicative of efforts by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
 We also consider that dialogue presupposes that all civilizations are of equal importance , that none of them can claim to be supreme , and that because of this , the dialogue among civilizations must necessarily mean that we reject exclusion and interference ; it means greater understanding , tolerance and respect for others . We consider that the essence of the dialogue among civilizations is to advocate cultural and religious diversity , which is a source of vitality and not a   cause   of division and confrontation . The dialogue will be possible only if we accept the fact that the international community as a whole shares the common values of tolerance and liberty and expresses the unshakable wish to live in a world where human rights are universally respected .
 We hope that the year 2001 , the international Year of Dialogue among Civilizations , will offer a specific and viable solution for the Palestinian question , because the Palestinian people continue to suffer humiliation and flagrant violations of their fundamental rights , and day after day the denial of their inalienable right to a State on their own territory with Al-Quds as the capital . It is equally important that , at the dawn of the twenty-first century , the United Nations should deal equally with all   causes   , without distinction . We continue to believe firmly that this is the best place for dialogue to take place , based on the principles of equality , justice , tolerance and respect for international law .
 I also join with the President of the Security Council in extending the condolences of the delegation of Mali to the delegation of the United States . Mali firmly condemns those barbarous attacks , which no   cause   could justify . We hope for the speedy recovery of the many persons injured , and we pray for the repose of the souls of those who have lost their lives in these attacks .
 Yesterday 's tragedy is an unacceptable crime , one which has afflicted innocent people . No civilization condones , and no   cause   whatever can justify , the odious crime perpetrated in three cities of this country on Tuesday , 11 September , just as the United Nations was preparing to ring the Peace Bell for the new millennium commencing this year . Taking place on the very day of the opening of the General Assembly , this brutal and malicious attack is both an outrage and a challenge to the entire international community .
 The leaders of the GCC countries expressed their happiness that His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , had returned , his health restored , from medical treatment overseas . They beseech Almighty God to bestow upon His Highness health and well-being and to grant him His assistance in his continued leadership of the United Arab Emirates and his continued participation in advancing the   causes   of the Arab and Islamic Nation . The Supreme Council reviewed the results of joint action in the economic , social , political , military , security , cultural and information fields .
 The situation in Mitrovica can not improve without the implementation of the comprehensive strategy that he spoke about , which would involve all of the communities and actors concerned , beginning with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo -LRB- UNMIK -RRB- . In that way we would be able to tackle the   causes   of the problem in Mitrovica and not just the manifestations of the problem . Fourthly , like other speakers , I would like to speak briefly on the situation in Macedonia. The recent developments there are very disturbing .
 Other institutions , such as UNDP and the World Bank , are currently involved in these types of studies . We regret that recent discussions engaged in by the Working Group have not advanced the   cause   of development . We would support further discussion in the proper forums that address the root of development and would help States Members of the United Nations reach our shared goals of poverty alleviation and sustainable development .
 -LRB- 6 -RRB- The precautionary principle was first affirmed in the âpan-Europeanâ Bergen Declaration adopted on 15 May 1990 by the member States of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe . It stated that âEnvironmental measures must anticipate , prevent and attack the   causes   of environmental degradation . Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage , lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.â The precautionary principle was recommended by the UNEP Governing Council in order to promote the prevention and elimination of marine pollution , which is increasingly becoming a threat to the marine environment and a cause of human suffering .
 The International Initiative Against Avoidable Disablement -LRB- IMPACT -RRB- is sponsored jointly by WHO , UNDP and UNICEF . The Initiative aims to prevent and reduce the   causes   of avoidable disability in countries and , as a result , to alleviate poverty through sustainable efforts at the community and international levels , targeting rehabilitation as a key intervention in reducing disability . Activities are carried out at the country level by the Initiative foundations , established in cooperation with interested professional , academic , and non-governmental groups .
 But there is also a need for moral clarity . There can be no acceptance of those who seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life , regardless of   cause   or grievance . In addition to measures taken by individual Member States , we must now strengthen the global norms against the use or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
 We should not quibble about the definition of terrorism , because we all know that the senseless and indiscriminate taking of innocent lives can only be the work of terrorists . They have no   cause   to fight for , and they make no demands prior to the perpetration of their acts . The 11 September attacks have seriously affected the economies of poor countries , which do not have the resilience of the major economies .
 But on 11 September the world saw terrorism on an unprecedented , horrifying scale . My Government , the British Government , has a simple message for terrorists and those who support terrorism : terrorism , the deliberate targeting of innocent people for political ends , is criminal , and there is no political , religious or ideological   cause   which can possibly justify the use of such indiscriminate violence . I am glad to say that the international resolve is strong .
 Some non-governmental organizations from the North working in the field of civil and political rights can be seen to be claiming a monopoly on the worldwide representation of so-called defenders , hindering access to international decision-making bodies by thousands of grass-roots and local organizations from the countries of the South . This criticism of the trends and dangers outlined above does not mean that the Government of Cuba is unaware of the importance of protecting individuals and groups which are being persecuted all over the world and even risking their lives for the   cause   of human rights . I would like to thank you for your comments in response to my note verbale dated 10 October 1999. I appreciate the openness with which you have expressed your Government 's position on the creation of the mechanism of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders .
 The right of access to the Supreme Court conferred by section 15 of the Constitution is expressly without prejudice to any other remedy which is lawfully available to the complainant . Many contraventions of a person 's fundamental human rights will indeed found alternative   causes   of action in the courts . For example , a person unlawfully deprived of his personal liberty may bring , or have brought on his behalf , civil proceedings to secure his release -LRB- by making an application for a writ of habeas corpus -RRB- .
 An appeal lies as of right to the Court of Appeal -LRB- and thence , with the leave of the Court of Appeal , to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council -RRB- from any decision of the Supreme Court under section 16 . In addition to the specific right of action given under section 16 of the Constitution , many infringements of the fundamental rights and freedoms protected by the Constitution will found alternative   causes   of action in the courts . Section 16 expressly does not prejudice these other remedies .
 Under the law on criminal procedure the defence has the right to challenge peremptorily up to two members of a jury without giving any reason . The defence and the prosecution have the right to challenge potential jurors for   cause   . People between the ages of 18 and 65 whose names appear on the electoral register , with certain exceptions , are liable for jury service and their names are chosen at random .

 On the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in Burundi and in Sierra Leone , we are pleased to say that significant milestones have been reached by all actors in the implementation of peace agreements already concluded . From that standpoint , there is true   cause   for encouragement in the beginning of an inter-Congolese dialogue in Gaborone , Botswana , and the recent formation , with the help of the incomparable Nelson Mandela , of the transitional government of Burundi for national reconciliation . It is now up to the Security Council to perform all of its responsibilities under Chapter VII of the Charter .
 It was also noted that the success of the programme was dependent on the level of support given to it . The view was expressed that activities within the Division for Palestinian Rights did not constitute an appropriate use of scarce United Nations resources , since they did nothing to advance the   cause   of reaching a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , and in fact complicated the search for a negotiated outcome . It was also expressed that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories was not only biased but also duplicative of efforts by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
 As leader of the Australian delegation , I should like to pay particular tribute to Ambassador Wensley 's outstanding contribution , dedication and hard work in the process of preparing a declaration of commitment for our Governments to adopt here at the special session . That declaration has the potential to show that the world community is serious about tackling the   causes   of HIV/AIDS , preventing its spread and caring for those who live with the virus . Our experience in Australia has been one of substantial success in reducing new levels of infection and has been based on three key principles .
 That legislation also provides that , in the interest of national security or public policy -LRB- ordre public -RRB- , a person to whom refugee status has been granted may be required to leave the State and be detained pending such removal . Irish refugee legislation also permits the detention of any applicant for refugee status who , inter alia , poses a threat to national security or public order in the State , has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State , has not made reasonable efforts to establish his or her identity , or who has , without reasonable   cause   , destroyed his or her identity or travel documents or is in possession of forged identity documents . Ongoing and appropriate liaison is maintained between the competent authorities and the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na for the purposes of the application of refugee legislation , including countering the threat posed by terrorism .
 Looking at peace-building from the conceptual standpoint , we remain of the view that it is inseparably linked to conflict prevention . In this context , we recognize the distinction between preventive peace-building , embracing a wide variety of long-term political , institutional and developmental activities to address the structural   causes   of conflicts , and post-conflict peace-building , encompassing reconstruction and development efforts to prevent the recurrence of conflict . We fully share the view that the time has come to define a common approach to peace-building and to work towards a comprehensive and universally agreed strategy for peace-building and conflict prevention , involving all international partners .
 As proposed , the successor mission to UNTAET would focus on the security of the new nation . In the most basic sense of the word , security continues to provide little   cause   for concern . Border infiltrations have not occurred during this year 's dry season â which , incidentally , is coming to an end â as a result of our robust response to last year 's significant and murderous threat , while the Indonesian armed forces now provide more resolute action against hardcore militia in West Timor .

 Although this provision implies discriminatory treatment , in that the regulation does not apply to male employees working under the same conditions , the reform does represent significant progress , because it provides that the Ministry of Labour must consult with social organizations representing women workers and also establishes liability for employers who fail to comply . -LRB- b -RRB- Articles 94 and 94a forbid the dismissal of a worker who is pregnant or a lactating mother , except when there are just   causes   arising from failure to comply with the duties set out in the employment contract . In such cases , the employer must report the intended dismissal to the National Employment Management and Inspection Board and prove the alleged fault .
 Inequalities between the sexes persisted in all countries with regard to both paid work and the distribution of household tasks . These and other forms of exploitation were also a   cause   of continuing underdevelopment . In reviewing economic opportunities for developing countries , therefore , it was important to recognize and accept the responsibility for identifying persistent gender inequalities in all their forms .
 The terrorist attacks here in our host city , in Washington , D.C. , and in Pennsylvania killed many thousands of innocent people , men and women , young and old , even infants . No   cause   can justify these horrors , which were so meticulously planned , coordinated , well funded and intended to attack the heart of our society . Those who assisted in any way with this evil should know that they have put themselves beyond the boundaries of civilized behaviour and humanity .
 My country , Iraq , has suffered and is still suffering from acts of terrorism , including State terrorism under different names . Consequently , we understand , and we are deeply aware of , the consequences of such acts that   cause   suffering and sacrifices among innocent people . This was our feeling towards the loss of civilian victims as a result of the explosions in the United States recently .
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . -LRB- See also paras. 16-17 , 20-21 and 26 above .
 The General Department of Traffic -LRB- Ministry of the Interior -RRB- asked him , as the owner of the vehicle by means of which the offence had been committed , to identify the perpetrator of the offence or driver of the vehicle , in other words , himself . Vial -LRB- LSV -RRB- -RRB- , which states : âThe owner of the vehicle , on being duly asked to do so , has the duty to identify the driver responsible for the offence ; if he fails to fulfil this obligation promptly without justified   cause   , he shall be liable to a fine for having committed a serious misdemeanourâ . 2.2 Pursuant to this request and exercising the fundamental right not to confess guilt , Mr. SÃ¡nchez LÃ³pez sent the traffic authorities a letter in which he stated that he was not the driver of the vehicle and did not know who had been driving it since he had lent it to several people during that period .
 See communication No. 619/1995 -LRB- F. Diedrick v. Jamaica -RRB- . Section 229 of the Criminal procedure Act reads : âRegardless of the severity of the penalty , any person who is with just   cause   suspected of any offence may be arrested if he : -LRB- 1 -RRB- is caught in the act and does not desist from the punishable activity . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The provision of section 228 -LRB- 2 -RRB- shall apply accordingly.â Section 228 -LRB- 2 -RRB- reads : âAn arrest shall not be made if , considering the nature of the case and other circumstances this would constitute a disproportionate measure.â
 Recalling its resolutions 53/92 of 7 December 1998 and 54/234 of 22 December 1999 on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Having considered the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , as well as the note by the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 54/234 , Recalling its resolution 46/151 of 18 December 1991 , the annex to which contains the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s , its resolutions 48/214 of 23 December 1993 , 49/142 of 23 December 1994 and 51/32 of 6 December 1996 , on the mid-term review of the New Agenda , as well as its resolution 53/90 of 7 December 1998 on the implementation of the New Agenda , as well as chapter VII of the United Nations Millennium Declaration ,
 TUPRAS claims that the interruption in deliveries of Iraqi crude oil forced TUPRAS to secure alternative supplies of crude oil from other markets , and thus caused it to incur additional costs . In TUPRAS ' view , Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait is the   cause   of its losses because the invasion caused the shutdown of the Iraq-Turkey pipeline , which in turn caused TUPRAS ' losses . Central to TUPRAS ' claim is the suspension of crude oil deliveries through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline .
 The joint action proposes the establishment of a revolving fund that can make seed capital available to beneficiaries , enabling them to start microenterprises . The third proposal is a pilot project on nutrition in Pakistan , where three of the five major   causes   of death associated with pregnancy and childbirth are related to malnutrition . The pilot project will help to improve the nutritional status of pregnant and nursing women .
 Contraceptive prevalence is low at 17 per cent and total fertility rate is correspondingly high at 5.3 births per woman.56 Although 95 per cent of pregnant women received prenatal care57 and 90 per cent were attended at delivery by trained personnel , 58 the maternal mortality ratio remained high at 350 per 100 , 000 live births.59 HIV/AIDS was reported to affect 0.05 per cent of adults at the end of 1999 , 60 but experience elsewhere would indicate that there may be under-reporting and , given existing social-cultural patterns , including those influencing relations between men and women , there should be no   cause   for complacency . Education levels are high , as illiteracy at age 15-24 is 1.7 for women and 1.9 for men , while at ages above 25 years it is 5.2 for both men and women.61
 No part of the world was free from human rights violations and no individual should believe himself or herself immune from them . Thus , if the human rights system was to serve the cherished and noble   causes   enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it must keep an eye on all parts of the world . Building on that assumption , it behoved everyone , individually and collectively , to contribute to fair , just and constructive engagement in the United Nations human rights activities .

 Money laundering : facilitating the retention or control of terrorist property in any way , including concealment ; removal from the jurisdiction ; and transfer to nominees . All of these apply in situations where a person intends , or has reasonable   cause   to suspect , that money or property will be used for the purposes of terrorism . The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 14 years imprisonment and/or a fine .
 In October 1999 , Cuba had signed with the Agency an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and had been the first country in the world to conclude an agreement on the application of the safeguards system under INFCIRC/66 . Cuba would continue to develop its programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy under conditions of complete openness to scrutiny and had taken up the   cause   of nuclear disarmament and total prohibition of nuclear weapons . The Cuban delegation had taken note of the statement by the representative of Belarus and in that connection wished to indicate that in recent years Cuba had accepted for treatment more than 10 , 000 children who had suffered as a result of the Chernobyl accident .
 The notion of the highest attainable standard of health in article 12 , paragraph 1 , takes into account both the individual 's biological and socio-economic preconditions and a State 's available resources . There are a number of aspects which can not be addressed solely within the relationship between States and individuals ; in particular , good health can not be ensured by a State , nor can States provide protection against every possible   cause   of human ill health . Thus , genetic factors , individual susceptibility to ill health and the adoption of unhealthy or risky lifestyles may play an important role with respect to an individual 's health .
 In addition , if oil prices remained persistently high , they could cause difficulties for world economic growth in general . In his delegation 's view , the   causes   might lie in inadequacies of the international financial architecture . Developing countries needed to be integrated in the decision-making processes of the international financial systems so that their concerns were fully taken into account .
 The year 2000 marked not only the beginning of a new millennium , but also the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- . This occasion , however , did not offer   cause   for celebration , as hopes for peace were tempered by continued conflict in many regions of the world , frequently the result of unresolved tensions among ethnic communities . While there were no new refugee emergencies on the scale experienced in recent years , UNHCR continued to face a great number of challenging refugee and forced displacedment situations , often exacerbated by natural disasters .
 Finally , we hope that the International Conference on Financing for Development , to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , next March , will devote particular attention to Africa 's needs . Mr. Tekle -LRB- Eritrea -RRB- : Allow me to begin my statement by thanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report of April 1998 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group for the report on this item .
 If the above Commission is unable to give an opinion within 30 days , the requirement concerning the issue of a prior opinion is considered to have been met -LRB- sect. 30 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of Legislative Decree No . The Government stated , in this connection , that employers may dismiss workers only in the general framework of dismissal for just   cause   ; the law does not prohibit termination of employment during maternity leave , but aims to ensure equal treatment for men and women workers in the event of dismissal . In this respect , the Committee noted with interest that new section 18-A of Act No. 4/84 on maternity protection , as amended , now refers to the prohibition of dismissing pregnant women , women who have just given birth or nursing mothers .
 The Committee also noted that the opinions of the Commission do not appear to be binding , even if the Government states that in most cases where the Commission has given an unfavourable opinion , the dismissal has not been carried out . Furthermore , the Committee recalled that the notion of just   cause   , under Portuguese law concerning dismissal , also includes disciplinary grounds , about which the legislation is very unspecific . In that context , the Committee recalled that article 6 of the Convention aims to prohibit the employer from dismissing a woman who is absent from her work on maternity leave or from giving her notice of dismissal at such time that the notice would expire during the absence , and asked the Government to reconsider this matter and to indicate in its next report the measures taken or envisaged to give full effect to this article of the Convention .
 The involvement of the Economic and Social Council was also requested in February 2000 , when the Security Council proposed that it convene a meeting to discuss the impact of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome -LRB- HIV/AIDS -RRB- on peace and security in Africa . More recently , in its resolution 55/217 , the General Assembly requested the Economic and Social Council to consider the proposals of the Assembly 's Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , particularly on the creation of an ad hoc advisory group on countries emerging from conflict . An advisory group similar to that on Haiti has now been established for that purpose .

 First , there is an urgent need for an agreement on a comprehensive convention to fight international terrorism . âThere can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life , regardless of   cause   or grievance.â -LRB- A/56/PV.12 -RRB- Surely the peoples of the world whom we represent here will not understand or forgive us if we fail to quickly arrive at an agreed comprehensive convention because some of us may descend to being pedantic .
 Mr. Kittikhoun -LRB- Lao People 's Democratic Republic -RRB- : The situation in the Middle East continues to be a matter of grave concern to the international community . Acts of violence flare up , inflict destruction , damage property ,   cause   great loss of life and generate deep sorrow and desire for revenge among both the Palestinian and Israeli people . The Lao People 's Democratic Republic expresses its concern over the current situation in the region and strongly condemns these acts of violence and the excessive use of force against the Palestinians .
 Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Progress report of the Secretary-General**
 I. Introduction1 The report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- , which was considered by the General Assembly , the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council , contained a series of specific as well as broad recommendations on issues ranging form post-conflict peace-building to the mobilization of resources for development . The report highlighted the critical nexus between peace and development and advanced a comprehensive and integrated approach to conflict prevention , poverty eradication and development .
 Seminars , conferences and consciousness-raising The Centre provided technical and substantive support to a group of African and Europe-based civil society organizations seeking practical ways to stop the proliferation and rampant use in violent conflicts of mercenaries and private militias and the privatization of security in the region , at the Methodological Planning Workshop on   Causes   , Consequences and Responses to Private Intervention in Armed Conflicts in Africa -LRB- Monrovia , Liberia , 27 July to 1 August 2000 -RRB- . The Workshop explored various forms of responses to the problem -LRB- including local field engagement and research -RRB- and identified potential projects and actions capable of advancing conflict resolution in the region .
 Inaugurated on 30 January 2001 by the Prime Minister of Togo , the Forum is open to the diplomatic corps , civil society organizations active in disarmament issues , research institutions and universities , and provides an opportunity for various actors to suggest practical solutions to the numerous security-related problems with which the continent is confronted . Some of the topics discussed at recent Forums included âCrisis in Central Africa :   causes   , violence , actors , stakes and perspectivesâ , âThe future of peace-keeping in Africaâ , âTraditional methods of conflict prevention , management and resolution in Africa : The case of the Great Lakes regionâ and âEmbargoes and other sanctions as conflict prevention measures in Africaâ . The Centre provided its expertise to a meeting of governmental experts from the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region -LRB- Uganda , 11-12 June 2001 -RRB- .
 I urge the United Nations system to provide the maximum support for African States and to help foster productive and mutually beneficial partnerships between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector . The General Assembly will continue to play a major role in assessing and monitoring progress in Africa and make necessary recommendations , mainly through the work of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , as well as through the preparatory process for the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s . I now give the floor to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania to introduce draft resolution A/56/L.28 .
 Central to these initiatives have been efforts to ensure coordination and coherence . In this respect , the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa constituted a major development in the way the United Nations should respond to Africa 's development concerns . The report reflected acute awareness of the nexus between peace and development and made recommendations for a comprehensive and integrated approach to conflict prevention , poverty eradication and development .
 Mr. Bishnoi -LRB- India -RRB- : We thank the Secretary-General for document A/56/371 , in which he reports on the progress of the implementation of the recommendations contained in his April 1998 report -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We also thank the Permanent Representatives of Spain and of Pakistan for their work as co-Vice-Chairmen of the Assembly 's Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , and would like to place on record our appreciation for the report -LRB- A/56/45 -RRB- of the Group . It has always been our conviction that Africa knows its own problems better than anybody else and that its understanding of the situation can not be replaced by that of others .
 Poverty is a cause as well as a consequence of violent conflicts and is endemic to many parts of Africa . Norway welcomes the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa focusing on conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building and education . In spite of a number of positive programmes and projects investing in human resources , the Working Group notes with concern that human resources capacity in many African countries remains weak and is inadequate for the challenges of the twenty-first century .
 My delegation also thanks the Secretary-General for his report . Once again , we have an opportunity to address the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . This time , however , we do so against the background of the upcoming review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and , more significantly , the adoption by African leaders of the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- .
 The Office has assisted the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons in the implementation of his mandate , since his appointment in 1992 . Although initially charged with studying the   causes   and consequences of internal displacement , the Representative 's mandate has evolved into four main areas of work : developing a normative framework for the protection and assistance of the internally displaced ; developing effective institutional responses at the international and regional levels ; undertaking missions to countries affected by internal displacement and entering into solutions-oriented dialogue with the Governments concerned and other relevant actors ; and carrying out research into various aspects of internal displacement . The Representative plays an important role in raising awareness of the global crisis on internal displacement .
 The following are rights of urban and rural workers , among others that aim to improve their social status : Employment with protection against arbitrary dismissal or against dismissal without proper   cause   , pursuant to a supplementary law that shall determine severance pay , among other rights ; Unemployment insurance , in the event of involuntary unemployment ;
 Part of the problem in integrating environmental and trade policies was that some people regarded environmental measures as ends in themselves , rather than as an essential component of sustainable development . Environmental protection and economic development were often viewed as separate issues , and those who argued for environmental   causes   failed to address the urgent need to generate wealth to provide for the essential needs of poor people , particularly in developing countries , and vice versa . Attempts to establish a link between environmental issues and labour standards in the trade policy debate have complicated efforts to address either issue .
 The first one is the moral pillar . If there were any arguments that terrorists might also have a defensible   cause   , 11 September must have put this forever to rest . There are no grey areas in the fight against terrorism , nor are there good terrorists and bad terrorists .
 In Barbados , the Comoros , Lebanon and Turkey , it was mandatory for capital murder . According to the reply from Japan , the Penal Code demanded the death penalty for an offence of conspiring with a foreign State to cause the use of armed forces against Japan , but a judge could reduce the death penalty to another sentence where legal   causes   existed or where the judge considered the death penalty to be too severe for the case . It appears from Bahrain 's reply that capital punishment is mandatory for the premeditated murder of a police officer .
 The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo brought in several countries and generated rebellions against the Government . In a genuine attempt to find solutions to the multiple   causes   of the conflict , the belligerents negotiated the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement with the assistance of countries of the region . That Agreement addresses the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , including control over its resources , the rights of the Congolese people and the security of neighbouring countries .
 C. Separation of civilians and armed elements In my report of 1998 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- , I recognized that the safety of refugees had increasingly become a matter of international concern , as had the security of States hosting large refugee populations or having such populations near their borders . This assessment has not changed .
 The dialogue among civilizations is very important if we wish to achieve the objectives of eliminating racism and racial discrimination and consolidating human rights through cooperation and understanding . In this respect , we must remember that diversity is a source of strength and not a   cause   for division. As the Holy Koran says , âO mankind !
 Israel attributed its actions against UNRWA and its personnel to security considerations . In that connection , the question arose as to whether such considerations really guided the Israeli forces which shelled UNRWA schools and attacked its employees and whether they had really given   cause   for the restrictions placed on the Commissioner-General himself . The representative of Israel had also stated that the political issues in the region were presented in a one-sided and subjective manner in the UNRWA report .
 Its bloody practices , its innocent , random victims and its disdain for human life make it entirely condemnable . Any   cause   that might be invoked to justify a terrorist act loses its legitimacy forever because of the inhuman methods and nature . The item of terrorism within the United Nations was added to the General Assembly 's agenda in 1972 .
 As long as political , economic and social injustice are allowed to prevail there will always be people trying to exploit them for their narrow political agendas or criminal purposes . As long as the international community lacks the capacity to put an end to conflicts and address their real   causes   , there will be no shortage of recruits for all sorts of desperate acts . While adopting the necessary measures to eliminate the threat posed by the activities of terrorist groups , as well as their masterminds and supporters , it is important to ensure that the already scarce resources intended to promote the economic and social development of developing countries are not diverted .
 New PP13 bis2 : -LSB- Affirming that identification and acknowledgement of the sources , causes and manifestations of racism and racial discrimination such as colonialism , slavery , slave trade and other forms of servitude , which has been pursued in the past and their resolution are crucial to the prevention of recurrence of such policies and practices as well as attitudes and tendencies emanating from these evils and thus in saving the present and future generations from suffering and deprivation of all human rights thereof. -RSB- PP7bis1 -LSB- Reaffirming that colonization by settlers and foreign occupation constitute sources ,   causes   and forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , -RSB- PP13bis Fully aware that , despite efforts undertaken by the international community , Governments and local authorities , the scourge of racism , racial discrimination , -LSB- * -RSB- xenophobia and related intolerance persist and continue to result in violations of human rights , in suffering , disadvantage and violence , which must be combated by all available and appropriate means and as a matter of the highest priority , preferably in cooperation with affected communities , -LRB- adopted , list pending -RRB-
 International NGOs have complemented the development efforts of Governments and civil society , and have supported the growing involvement of national and local organizations in debates on economic policy and in action for reducing poverty . If the community of nations is to make good on its decade-old promise to give every child a better future , all of us must join in common   cause   as never before â Governments , multinational organizations and civil society in all its diversity , including the private sector and the business community . Several corporations have responded to such calls , including those participating in the global compact of the Secretary-General .
 Constraints in immunization programmes have also included the inability of countries to introduce new and underutilized vaccines due to inadequate funding . In addition , the hepatitis B , haemophilus influenzae type b -LRB- a leading   cause   of pneumonia and meningitis -RRB- and yellow fever vaccines are not yet widely available in many of the countries of greatest need . Some 25 countries significantly increased their own financing of immunization services between 1995 and 2000 .
 Actors in these societies recognized that change was possible , and they mobilized for change . Often , they adopted the   cause   of children 's rights in their advocacy for reform and promoted programmes that focused on all children . Clear and effective policies , combined with child-friendly legislation and systems for accountability , together with an adequate funding and information base , strong political will , broad public-private-community coalitions and attention to the poorest and most vulnerable , have been found to be central in the 1990s to reducing the gap between promises and action â and to making rapid progress for children .
 In this respect , the Conference expressed its condolences to and sympathy with the people and Government of the United States and the families of the victims in these mournful and tragic circumstances . The Conference , proceeding from the provisions of the OIC Convention on Combating International Terrorism , reaffirmed the willingness of its member States to effectively contribute to an international collective effort , under the umbrella of the United Nations as the forum where all States of the world are represented , to define the phenomenon of terrorism in all its forms and without selectiveness or double standards and to contribute also to addressing its   causes   , eradicating its roots and achieving international security and stability . The Conference stressed that such shameful terrorist acts are opposed to the tolerant divine message of Islam which spurns aggression , calls for peace , coexistence , tolerance and respect among people , highly prizes the dignity of human life and prohibits the killing of the innocent .
 The Minister of Finance is authorized , under subsection -LRB- b -RRB- to confiscate such property . Regulation 84 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- grants authority to enter into premises in which there is   cause   to believe that there is such property or documents relating to such property , and to confiscate them . Regulation 74 grants authority to seize such property or documents .
 Criminal Procedure Ordinance -LRB- Search and Seizure -RRB- -LSB- New Version -RSB- -LRB- 1969 -RRB- Pursuant to Section 32 of the Ordinance , the police is authorized to seize an item if it has   cause   to believe that the item was used or about to be used for the commission of an offence , or that it is likely to serve as evidence in a legal proceeding relating to an offence , or that it was given as payment for the commission of an offence or as a means of committing it . This item -LRB- which could include money -RRB- can be held by the police and if an indictment is not filed regarding the relevant offence within six months , it must be returned .

 It was also noted that the success of the programme was dependent on the level of support given to it . The view was expressed that activities within the Division for Palestinian Rights did not constitute an appropriate use of scarce United Nations resources , since they do nothing to advance the   cause   of reaching a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , and in fact complicate the search for a negotiated outcome . It was also expressed that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories is not only biased but also duplicative of efforts by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
 Such an act is not only a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and a serious distortion of the nature of this Organization but also a brazen challenge to the one-China principle widely recognized by the international community. It has severely encroached upon China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and grossly interfered in China 's internal affairs . The Chinese Government strongly condemns and firmly opposes it and requests these countries to immediately correct this illegal act that has obstructed the lofty   cause   of China 's peaceful reunification . There is but one China in the world and Taiwan has been a part of China 's territory since antiquity .
 Such separatist moves by the Taiwan authorities are the source of tension in the Taiwan Straits . And the paper submitted by the above-mentioned handful of countries will only serve to add fuel to the separatist moves of the Taiwan authorities , undermine the lofty   cause   of China 's reunification and jeopardize peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large . The Chinese Government firmly opposes this .
 Upon the conviction of a person for an offence under this Regulation , any funds or other financial assets or resources of such persons shall , by reason of such conviction , be forfeited to the State. -LRB- Clause 8 -RRB- The provisions of Regulation No. 1 of 2001 , further cast a duty upon any person who has knowledge or reasonable   cause   to believe that any person has committed an offence under the Regulation or is making preparations or attempting to commit an offence or has in his possession any information relating to the movements or whereabouts of any person who has committed or is making preparations or is attempting to commit an offence , to report the same to a police officer . Any person who fails to so report commits an offence thereby and shall , on conviction by the High Court be liable to imprisonment of either description for a period not less than two years and not exceeding seven years .
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia expresses serious concern regarding the disruption , by the Abkhaz side , of the Georgian-Abkhaz Coordinating Council session , scheduled for 17 July 2001 in Tbilisi . The Abkhaz side has again exhibited its destructive position and reluctance to cooperate , citing as the   cause   the incident which took place on the territory temporarily beyond the control of the Georgian authorities , where the separatist regime continues to demonstrate its total inability to provide security for the civilian population . The disruption by the Abkhaz side of the Coordinating Council session leads us to conclude that such actions are premeditated , designed to halt the peace process and to further depress the already difficult course of negotiations .
 Rule 8 By-elections If a member of the Commission dies or resigns or for any other   cause   can no longer perform his or her duties , the Meeting of States Parties will , in accordance with article 76 and Annex II to the Convention , elect a member for the remainder of the predecessor 's term .

 food : pollution of raw materials , substandard handling of food ; to reduce the number of emergencies ; to improve the ambient air in working premises ; to improve the quality of food ; to improve the working environment ; to reduce   causes   of noise ; to alleviate the causes of psychical stress . In 1997 the Estonian Parliament adopted the National Environmental Strategy .
 Once again , education to change perceptions , was the solution . Her Government believed that good legislation , achieved through negotiation , dialogue and international cooperation , was the best way to achieve the advancement of women , and it was ready to contribute in any way possible to that   cause   . Miss Durrant -LRB- Jamaica -RRB- said that the goals of gender equality and the promotion of women 's rights remained primary challenges in the global effort to achieve sustainable development and peace .
 Many claimed settlements were a prime cause of the present intifada , a view shared by international organizations working in the West Bank and Gaza . The Commission reaffirms that settlements in the West Bank and Gaza constitute a major violation of international humanitarian law and identify the presence of settlements and settlers as a primary   cause   of many violations of human rights in the OPT . RIGHTS : EFFECTS OF CLOSURES , CURFEWS , RESTRICTIONS ON
 The United Nations has the mandate , the means and the expertise to assist in the resolution of armed conflict and thus to remove one of the major obstacles to development . That factor was clearly set out in the Secretary-General 's landmark 1998 report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- . Secondly , African countries must be assisted in their efforts to ensure investment in human resource development , capacity-building and the acquisition and application of technologies for development .
 This item was included in the agenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly , in 1998 , as an additional item at the request of Namibia -LRB- A/53/231 -RRB- . In April 1998 , at the request of the Security Council , the Secretary-General had submitted a report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . The General Assembly considered the item at its fifty-third to fifty-fifth sessions -LRB- resolutions 53/92 , 54/234 and 55/217 -RRB- .
 A particular focus of UNHCR 's work over the last year has been to seek to prevent asylum-seekers being held in prisons with convicted criminals , to avoid separation of families and the detention of minors -LRB- see also section V.B below -RRB- , and to address reports of verbal , physical or sexual abuse . The 1951 Convention clearly prohibits the imposition of penalties on refugees present in or entering a country of asylum illegally , provided they come directly from a territory where their life or freedom have been threatened , present themselves without delay to the authorities , and show good   cause   for their illegal entry or presence . Over the reporting period , in countries which have continued to detain or otherwise penalize refugees and asylum-seekers , UNHCR has worked to ameliorate the regime and conditions of detention and promote their early release .
 In conclusion , the Special Rapporteur has raised the issue of women , peace and security out of a deep concern that women are not full participants in efforts to prevent , stop and recover armed conflict . The Special Rapporteur again emphasizes that effective participation depends on the ability to express oneself freely , to have access to the materials needed in order to have an informed opinion , to join with others in common   cause   for the common good , and to meet openly and without fear in order to discuss more widely the issues at hand and to act upon the decisions taken . None of these actions is possible when the rights to opinion , expression , information , assembly and association are violated .
 During his mission , the Special Rapporteur met with First Vice-President Taha and raised this issue with him , encouraging him to take positive steps to address the situation . The First Vice-President expressed his personal commitment to this   cause   and promised to take a public stand to this end , although so far there has been no public announcement in this sense . Recently , however , the First Vice-President pledged 10 million Sudanese dinars -LRB- roughly $ 40 , 000 -RRB- to cover local requirements for forthcoming CEAWC activities .
 Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- United Kingdom -RRB- : I am grateful for your indulgence , Mr. President , and I apologize to you and to members of the Council for being late for the meeting and for darting in and out . But it is in a good   cause   , because the work of the Security Council is under scrutiny next door in the Trusteeship Council . You started the session off yourself , Mr. President , and I think it would be wise if members of the Council were represented there .
 The commitments proposed in the important section on resources are aimed at ensuring that additional , new and sustainable resources are drawn from all possible sources in order to carry out the crusade against HIV/AIDS . If we are to fight effectively against this daunting epidemic that daily   causes   further devastation , substantial resources must be available . Between now and 2005 , an annual global expenditure of between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion should be progressively mobilized to combat HIV/AIDS .
 Mindful of the ministerial declaration of the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2001 of the Economic and Social Council , on the role of the United Nations system in supporting the efforts of African countries to achieve sustainable development , Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa1 and the progress report of the Secretary-General ; 2 Notes with deep concern that access to education at all levels in Africa remains low , despite the recognition that education plays a central role in conflict prevention and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development ;
 Invites the Working Group to re-examine its mandate during the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly , including the most appropriate way to proceed with the deliberations of the Working Group as well as the scope and nature of its work ; Decides to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ; 4 Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session a comprehensive report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report , including concrete measures needed to ensure a coordinated and integrated approach to the full and early implementation of the recommendations ;
 3.1 The author claims that the removal of her guardianship rights over her six children is in violation of articles 17 and 23 of the Covenant , as this allegedly constitutes arbitrary interference in the exercise of her rights as a mother . The author considers that regardless of the conditions under which the children lived with her , it is her right as a mother to have her children with her and that there is no possible   cause   to remove the children from her care . 3.2 She claims that the authorities have interfered in her life and have taken the children away because she is a newborn Christian and consequently the decision to remove the children constitutes a violation of article 18 .
 It was suggested that the provisions on replacement or removal of the representative should be linked to the representative 's failure to act according to the required standard , with the reservation that , depending on the role and prerogatives of creditors given in the proceedings , it might be appropriate to leave the creditors free to remove the representative without having to give any justification therefor . In that respect it was suggested that where the draft Guide dealt with removal , whether or not for   cause   , it should also discuss the need for the insolvency law to provide for substitution and succession in title to the assets of the estate . It was noted that insolvency representatives were regarded in some countries as officers of the court , which determined their level of responsibility and grounds for removal .
 Welcoming the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as a centre for the coordination of all activities of United Nations bodies concerned with small arms , Thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement by the President of the Security Council on small arms on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations resulting from the meetings of the States of the subregion held at Banjul Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,
 The final substantive session will be from 14 to 25 January 2002 -LRB- Assembly resolutions 55/213 and 55/245 -RRB- . Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa Terms of reference
 We would like to draw the attention of the international community to the fact that old mines are no less dangerous than more recent ones . Both   cause   incalculable suffering . That is why the international community should step up its efforts to deal with them in the same manner as with more recently placed mines .
 We appreciate the position of the great majority of Member States who have abided by the one-China principle and opposed Taiwan 's participation in international organizations that can only be composed of sovereign States . We thank all countries that have upheld justice on the question of Taiwan and supported China 's great   cause   of reunification . At the same time , we are confident that any separatist act to create âtwo Chinasâ , or âone China , one Taiwanâ , is against the tide of history , and any attempt to support such acts will be doomed to failure .
 The statistics already provided , among the annexes to this report , concerning numbers , ages , sexes and ethnic groups at particular salary levels in occupations obviously lend themselves to a variety of interpretations , and confident conclusions bearing on the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of proper opportunities for promotion can hardly be drawn . Clearly , however , for whatever   cause   , much ground remains to be made up by various groups , as shown by the following recent analysis of representation in the top three tiers of management in the private sector : Percentage of the total top three tiers of management in respondent organizations
 It also means that we must establish and strengthen democracy , good governance and respect for human rights . We believe that in accordance with the wise distribution of competence established by the Charter , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council are the appropriate bodies to implement and coordinate efforts to tackle the structural   causes   of armed conflicts . The Security Council , for its part , has the task of what has been termed operational prevention , which is aimed at adopting measures with regard to an imminent crisis .
 What it can undoubtedly do is to contribute to the prevention process in the areas within its mandate . It is self-evident that one of the most effective ways to prevent a conflict is to address the   causes   that can trigger it . If we bear in mind that poverty , discrimination and the lack of economic prospects are among the most recurrent causes of conflicts , it is not difficult to conclude that prevention-related topics and actions should be at the core of the General Assembly 's and the Economic and Social Council 's work .
 In the Millennium Declaration , Member States devoted special attention to Africa and called on the United Nations system to play a catalytic role in mobilizing resources in the cause of African development . The recommendations contained in my report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- remain an important point of departure . The implementation of those recommendations has been entrusted to the General Assembly Ad Hoc Working Group , whose progress report of November 2000 contained a concise overview of the progress in and constraints to their implementation .
 President Jiang Zemin made clear to the world China 's future objectives , guiding principles and domestic and foreign policies in the important speech that he delivered on 1 July this year . The principal task for the Chinese people in the new century is to press ahead with the modernization programme , work towards the grand   cause   of national reunification , safeguard world peace and promote common development . Indeed , the purpose of China 's foreign policy is to safeguard world peace and promote common development .
 As regards the latter , the Court is required to respect the general principles of criminal law and the requirements of a fair trial . However , while there is   cause   to rejoice at this , we must put a damper on this favourable assessment because of some provisions of the Statute , such as article 16 , which establishes the right of the Security Council to obstruct the prosecutor 's action , and article 31 , paragraph 1 -LRB- c -RRB- , which includes self defence as one of the grounds for exemption from criminal responsibility . The second theme , âIdentification of problems posed by the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunalâ , was introduced by Mr. Gilbert Bitti .
 It is assumed that any work requiring considerable physical effort is incompatible with pregnancy after the fourth monthâ . Article 113 provides that : âAs soon as pregnancy begins and until the end of the post-natal leave , de facto dismissal or dismissal resulting from previous legal proceedings shall not lead to the termination of a female worker 's contract , unless the   cause   of such dismissal pre-dates the pregnancy ; however , even in the latter case , dismissal shall not take effect until immediately after the end of the above-mentioned period of leaveâ . Article 309 concerns the employer 's obligation to grant pregnant working women 12 weeks of maternity leave , six of which must be taken after the child is born , and must also pay in advance the equivalent of 75 per cent of the woman 's basic wage during such leave .
 The main difficulty was to distinguish between the effects of sanctions and other factors that influenced the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan . Specific case studies , in areas such as civil aviation and transport safety or the availability of essential drugs , investigated the link between the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and the individual sanctions measures. They followed the chain of causality and tested whether any deterioration in the humanitarian situation occurred and whether this was attributable to the sanctions regime or to other   causes   . Humanitarian implications of the sanctions measures
 Africa receives less than 2 per cent of global FDI , but , in relation to GDP , it is the most externally indebted region in the world . Despite these long-term difficulties , in the past few years the economic performance of some countries in the region has given   cause   for a greater degree of optimism . Circumstances and performance vary widely among countries but , despite the weak commodity prices of the past few years , some countries have begun to grow at rates , which , if sustained , would achieve the target of reducing extreme poverty by half by 2015 .
 It would be unfair and inconsistent with the policy of debtor protection to require the debtor to determine who among several claimants has priority and to have the debtor pay a second time if , in the first instance , it has paid the wrong person . The debtor would most likely have a   cause   of action against that person , but the debtor 's rights may be frustrated if that person becomes insolvent . The risk of insolvency of the person who received payment should be on the various claimants of the receivables and not on the debtor .
 Paragraph 3 is intended to ensure that the debtor may not raise against the assignee by way of defence or set-off the breach of a contractual limitation on assignment by the assignor . The debtor may have a   cause   of action against the assignor , if , under law applicable outside the draft Convention , the assignment constitutes a breach of contract that results in a loss to the debtor . However , the mere existence of a contractual limitation is not a violation of the representation contained in article 14 , paragraph 1 -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- see A/CN.9/489 , para .
 United Nations Report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa General Assembly
 United Nations â¢ New York , 2001 Report of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa Note
 In the course of its work , the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Causes of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa had before it the following documents : -LRB- a -RRB- Report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- Report of the Economic and Social Council for 2000 -LRB- A/55/3 -RRB- ;
 There had been much progress in implementing the Convention in Egypt , but discrimination against women , both de jure and de facto , persisted in some areas . The situation was evolving continuously , however , and , the establishment in February 2000 of an institution focusing on women 's empowerment , the National Council for Women , of which she was the Secretary-General , had given Egypt 's women   cause   for optimism . The National Council had 11 standing committees , including the Legislative Committee and committees on culture and the media , economic development , education , environment and health .
 Last week , the sheikh of Al-Azhar University , the world 's oldest Islamic institution of higher learning , declared that terrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians . The terrorists call their   cause   holy , yet they fund it with drug dealing . They encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God 's blessing as they set out to kill innocent men , women and children .
 Nevertheless , to fight it it will also be necessary to move against other enemies of peace , such as poverty and underdevelopment , to give every person good reason to live and to make all of us guardians of humankind , which is a common good from which no one must feel excluded , and for which we must fight unwaveringly . There is no   cause   or banner that could justify this violence . That is precisely why we must prevent marginalization , helplessness and desperation from taking root in people 's souls so that they look approvingly and complacently on the criminal actions of which we are victims .
 Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ; Reaffirms that the   causes   of poverty should be addressed in an integrated way , taking into account the importance of sectoral strategies in such areas as education , development of human resources , health , human settlements , rural development , productive employment , population , environment , freshwater , food security and migration , and the specific needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , in such a way as to increase opportunities and choices for people living in poverty and to enable them to build and to strengthen their assets so as to achieve social and economic development ; Stresses the importance of increasing access to and control by the poor over resources , including land , skills , knowledge , capital and social connections , and of improving access for all to basic social services ;
 Terrorists seek to brutally sabotage any potential for a negotiated peace between Palestinians and Israelis and to undermine the Palestinian Authority in the process . As Secretary-General Annan has often said , terrorism can not be justified by any   cause   . Direct negotiations are the only route to our shared goal , and acts of terrorism are aimed at derailing direct negotiations .
 One Government -LRB- El Salvador -RRB- indicated that it does not ensure the above-mentioned conditions . Two Governments -LRB- Poland and Qatar -RRB- reported that lawyers assisting a client were identified with the   cause   of clients as a result of their functions as a lawyer . Some Governments -LRB- Chad , El Salvador , Guatemala , Latvia , Spain and United States -RRB- reported that a lawyer would be identified as such only in some cases .
 Continuing the embargo against Iraq at a time when the causes for imposing this embargo have been absent for years . Thus , a temporary measure has been transformed into a permanent measure , despite the absence of   causes   , in a manner unprecedented in the annals of this Organization . There is no doubt that this state of affairs could not have lasted this long without American hegemony over this world Organization , particularly the Security Council , as has been attested by various circles within and outside the United Nations â official and unofficial , political or otherwise â including United States and United Kingdom circles .
 Recalls paragraph 10 of General Assembly resolution 55/47 of 29 November 2000 , entitled âInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World , 2001-2010â , and , in this context , encourages the Department of Public Information to undertake specific dissemination of information on a culture of peace , keeping in mind the ongoing Decade ; Recalls its resolutions 53/59 B of 3 December 1998 and 54/82 B of 6 December 1999 , and urges the Department of Public Information to take the necessary measures , through the provision of relevant and objective information , towards achieving the major objectives set forth in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , 8 and to publicize the activities of the open-ended working group established for that purpose ; Also recalls its resolutions concerning the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster , in particular resolutions 51/138 of 13 December 1996 and 52/172 of 16 December 1997 , and encourages the Department of Public Information , in cooperation with the countries concerned and with the relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , to continue to take appropriate measures to enhance world public awareness of the consequences of that disaster ;
 Various delegations have expressed the wish that this debate would not dwell indefinitely on the definition of terrorism and that this task would be left to experts in international humanitarian law . While we understand this stance in view of the urgency of the situation and the criminal shock of 11 September , my delegation believes that the world coalition against terrorism will not be truly effective unless all the actors identify the   cause   of evil and attack its roots , instead of beginning by treating the symptoms . Indeed , terrorism was not born on 11 September. It has existed for a long time , and it kills thousands of innocent people throughout the world every day .
 Terrorism is morally and ethically indefensible . Under no circumstances must we seek to justify the killing of innocent people for any political   cause   . Terrorism is an international problem that requires a coordinated , multisectoral and multidimensional response at the national , regional and global levels .
 Since the mid-1990s , however , there have been sharp yearly fluctuations in such contributions , implying consequent fluctuations in delivery . In this connection , a review of the   causes   of such fluctuations might well be justified . The findings of the evaluation are attached to document E/ 2001/66 .
 It was incumbent upon the international community to indicate to Chairman Arafat the cost of his deeds and to point out to him that the only possible route was that which led to an honourable and agreed birth of a Palestinian State . The role of the international community should go beyond responding to the current situation and should include dealing with the basic   causes   of the crisis . Israel called on the international community to secure from Chairman Arafat an official statement regarding his commitments and an undertaking to refrain from unilateral actions .
 It is high time that we galvanized all these mechanisms and measures into concrete actions against individuals and entities engaged in terrorism , without seeking to discriminate between terrorist groups on the basis of their real or assumed cause or grievance . As we have learned painfully over the years in different places , from Mumbai to Karachi and from Colombo to New York , no   cause   or concern justifies terrorism . The common goal of such brutal violence is annihilation and destruction â the antithesis of what the United Nations and international community stand for .
 Participation by members of trade union organizations Representatives of trade unions may not be dismissed without good   cause   while in office , neither may they be transferred from their place of work without their agreement on grounds related to their union activities . Notice given in breach of that provision entitles the worker either to be re-employed in the company with all his rights as they stood at the date of dismissal or to receive compensation equal to one year 's wages as provided for in articles 32 , 33 , 35 and 36 of the Act in question .
 Malaria is still the principal cause of death in Angola and accounts for some 35 % of demand for medical care , 20 % of hospitalizations , 40 % of perinatal deaths and 25 % of maternal mortality . Measles ranks fifth in the   causes   of death . The rates of infant and child mortality are among the highest in the world : in 2001 the rates stood at 150 and 250 deaths per 1 000 children respectively .
 Healers and traditional mid-wives use unsterile instruments and certain puberty rituals and circumcision may also result in infection ; some private health care workers in urban areas and other healthcare units may also cause infection when administering vaccinations because of their lack of awareness and irresponsibility . The shortage of health-care equipment and tools is also sometimes a   cause   of virus spread because of the low level of acceptance that the virus exists and the low level of awareness among the public . This information is taken from the joint assessment of the country conducted in 2002 by the United Nations system in Angola .
 Cooperation between the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council In line with the recommendation in my report to the sixty-first session of the General Assembly on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/61/213 -RRB- , the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council held an historic meeting in New York in April 2008 to exchange views on issues of common concern and to establish closer and more structured cooperation . The two Councils reviewed conflict situations in the Sudan , Somalia , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and CÃ´te d'Ivoire .
 Article 28 If , within the period of time fixed by these Rules or the arbitral tribunal , without showing sufficient   cause   : -LRB- a -RRB- The claimant has failed to communicate its statement of claim , the arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings , unless the respondent has submitted a counterclaim ;
 -LRB- b -RRB- The respondent has failed to communicate its response to the notice of arbitration or its statement of defence , the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings continue , without treating such failure in itself as an admission of the claimant 's allegations ; the provisions of this subparagraph also apply to a claimant 's failure to submit a defence to a counterclaim or to a claim for the purpose of a set-off . If a party , duly notified under these Rules , fails to appear at a hearing , without showing sufficient   cause   for such failure , the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration . If a party , duly invited by the arbitral tribunal to produce documents , exhibits or other evidence , fails to do so within the established period of time , without showing sufficient cause for such failure , the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence before it .

Remarks on draft article 28
 Moreover , the Taliban 's use of drugs to finance terrorism was a classic case of narcoterrorism . UNODC should concentrate on immediate and specific   causes   and implement an effective and coordinated strategy for dealing with the problem . It seemed contradictory that the Executive Director should , on the one hand , state that Central America and the Caribbean were caught in the crossfire between the world 's largest producers and biggest consumers of cocaine , and then proceed to close down the UNODC regional office in Barbados , which had served 29 States and territories .
 A significant aspect of this legislation is that every employee must receive from his/her employer within one week of commencing employment a statement of employment setting out the essential particulars of the expectations of both parties . The Employment Act protects employees against termination without cause - termination for   cause   must be connected with ability , performance or conduct of the employee or because of operational requirements of the organisation . Dismissal therefore can only be for issues of misconduct , performance or redundancy .
 Continues to emphasize the central role of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons4 and its universality in achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation , and calls upon all States parties to respect their obligations ; Calls upon all States to comply fully with all commitments made regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any way that may compromise either   cause   or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race ; Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons3 sets out the agreed process for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament , and in this regard renews its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the implementation of the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conference , thereby contributing to a safer world for all ;

 Sixty-third session 29th plenary meeting New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support ;   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LSB- 57 -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- -RSB- : reports of the Secretary-General -LRB- A/63/206 and A/63/212 -RRB- ; 2001-2010 : Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa : note by the Secretary-General -LRB- A/63/219 -RRB- : joint debate The General Assembly resumed its consideration of agenda item 57 and its sub-items -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- and agenda item 43 .
 Myanmar believes that the imposition of an economic , commercial and financial embargo by the United States on Cuba is not conducive to promoting peace and stability in the region . Instead , these measures , by their adverse affects on the economy of Cuba ,   cause   undue suffering and hardship for the Cuban people and negatively impinge on third parties . Myanmar therefore strongly opposes the measures imposed by the United States .
 The report showed that change was occurring at an unprecedented rate and that humanity had yet to turn the corner to sustainable development ; all indicators were pointing to a worsening situation affecting both developed and developing economies . A number of innovations , or âgreen breakthroughsâ , gave   cause   for optimism , however , although they had not yet been scaled up to the point where they could provide a coherent global response . Despite the existence of improved tools , better science , a more informed public and a more proactive private sector , the threshold of sustained action was yet to be crossed .
 However , citizenship continues to be defined by many States as the primary legal bond between an individual and the State , which confers rights . Discrimination is both a   cause   and a consequence of State actions that seek to marginalize minorities . The reasons for which States discriminatorily deny or deprive persons of their right to citizenship are often rooted in racist ideologies .
 Access to information and means of communication , including information and communication technologies and systems , enables children with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life . Children with disabilities and their caregivers should have access to information concerning their disabilities so that they can be adequately educated on the disability , including its   causes   , management and prognosis . This knowledge is extremely valuable as it does not only enable them to adjust and live better with their disabilities , but also allows them to be more involved in and to make informed decisions about their own care .
 Children who commit offences are often subject to negative publicity in the media , which contributes to a discriminatory and negative stereotyping of these children and often of children in general . This negative presentation or criminalization of child offenders is often based on misrepresentation and/or misunderstanding of the   causes   of juvenile delinquency , and results regularly in a call for a tougher approach -LRB- e.g. zero-tolerance , three strikes and you are out , mandatory sentences , trial in adult courts and other primarily punitive measures -RRB- . To create a positive environment for a better understanding of the root causes of juvenile delinquency and a rights-based approach to this social problem , the States parties should conduct , promote and/or support educational and other campaigns to raise awareness of the need and the obligation to deal with children alleged of violating the penal law in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Convention .
 This training should be organized in a systematic and ongoing manner and should not be limited to information on the relevant national and international legal provisions . It should include information on , inter alia , the social and other   causes   of juvenile delinquency , psychological and other aspects of the development of children , with special attention to girls and children belonging to minorities or indigenous peoples , the culture and the trends in the world of young people , the dynamics of group activities , and the available measures dealing with children in conflict with the penal law , in particular measures without resorting to judicial proceedings -LRB- see chapter IV , section B , above -RRB- . DATA COLLECTION , EVALUATION AND RESEARCH
 Alternative care -LRB- 47 -RRB- The Committee welcomes the fact that the State party has legislated that poverty is not a sufficient   cause   for separating a child from his/her parents and that significant progress has been made in removing children from institutions . The Committee notes that the State party favours placing children with a substitute family or placing them up for adoption .
 We can not expect great progress which builds on some of the more important arms control agreements of the period of dÃ©tente in a new period in which there are those who seek to rekindle their old dreams of the encirclement of Russia by placing new weapons systems on its periphery . We can not expect our great Asian friends to come on board the consensus that is supposed to exist when there is open speculation as to whether or not this is the new enemy and whether , if it exercises its right of sovereignty or the adventurism of a secessionist island , there will be   cause   for the sole super-Power to defend that breakaway island with all its might , including the use of nuclear weapons . We will not make progress on the FMCT issue if we continue to demonize one or two States in a volatile arc of crisis , forgetting conveniently that there is at least one State with a long-standing nuclear weapons stockpile - a State which has invaded almost all its neighbours .
 With the Turkish Civil Code , the legal age for marriage has been raised , to over 17 for both men and women . However under extreme situations and sufficient   cause   both men and women who are over the age of 16 can be married with the permission of the judge . Legal registration of marriage is compulsory and one partner is legally permissable. However , illegal plural marriages are confronted at times .
 New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support -LRB- b -RRB-   Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa At its fifty-third session , in 1998 , the General Assembly , at the request of Namibia -LRB- A/53/231 -RRB- , included the item in its agenda and considered it at that session -LRB- resolution 53/92 -RRB- .
 Furthermore , where the use of armed violence becomes an engrained means for resolving individual and group grievances and conflicts , legal and peaceful dispute resolution mechanisms are eroded and the rule of law can not be upheld . Contemporary armed conflict is the main   cause   of people fleeing their homes , and is now the most common cause of food insecurity . For countries in the midst of long-term conflict as well as States in crisis or in a post-conflict phase and nations otherwise nominally âat peaceâ , armed violence can aggravate poverty , inhibit access to social services and divert energy and resources away from efforts to improve human development .
 As we consider the work of the Peacebuilding Commission over the past year , I wish to express our pleasure at the Commission 's achievements . The Commission 's limited experience does not yet allow us to claim that it has survived the test of the first five years , as the Brahimi report puts it , but the actions undertaken and their results to date are   cause   for optimism . My delegation takes this opportunity to address three very specific points .
 In enumerating the legislative mandates which gave impetus to the convening of the Seminar , Mr. Okio recalled that in S/PRST/2007/31 , the Council supported the comprehensive and global approach , recommended by the Secretary-General in his July 2006 report on the prevention of armed conflict , and suggested effective coordination between and within United Nations Organs , Programmes , Funds and Agencies involved in policy formulation and implementation , which was vital for ensuring better coherence of the existing mechanisms and striking the appropriate balance between peacekeeping operations and preventive activities . Also , the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 - S/1998/318 -RRB- , had become a subject of an annual review and recommendations by the General Assembly ; the latest report of the Secretary-General on the prevention of the armed conflicts -LRB- A/60/891 -RRB- , had recommended three approaches , namely , structural , operational and systemic prevention . Mr. Okio cited as being at the heart of âthis problemâ , the need to transform good intentions into concrete actions .
 Trinidad and Tobago drew attention to the provision in its criminal procedure that execution can not take place until the appeal is concluded or until the period during which appeals must be lodged -LRB- 14 days -RRB- has expired . The Japan Federation of Bar Associations indicated that the filing of an appeal for retrial or for amnesty in Japan is not considered to be a   cause   of suspension of the execution , and that the Committee against Torture has expressed concern in this regard . Minimum suffering
 Multilateral organizations must respond by taking an unequivocal moral stand against terrorism . No   cause   can justify the deliberate taking of innocent life , and the international community is nearing universal agreement on this truth . The vast majority of nations in this Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide bombing , hostage-taking and hijacking are never legitimate .
 His imminent departure from office , which comes suddenly , raises some concerns about what may happen if difficulties are experienced with the implementation of the agreement . I see no   cause   for alarm . The South African Government remains , and I am sure the new leadership will continue to be , seized of the matter .
 In addition to leaking urine , women may experience bladder infections , painful sores , kidney failure and infertility . The smell from the constant leaking combined with misperceptions about its   cause   often results in stigma and ostracism by communities . Many women are abandoned by their husbands and in some cases by their families .
 The Subcommittee , in stressing that extreme poverty is both a cause and a consequence of violations of human rights , suggests that the theme for the Second Decade should recognize the link between extreme poverty and human rights . Substantive areas that could be considered for a programme of work for the Decade could include : working towards an agreed definition of extreme poverty ; highlighting the importance of quality education ; addressing the   causes   of poverty in the context of intersectoral strategies ; making health care accessible and affordable ; integrating a gender dimension into poverty eradication policies ; and reducing military expenditures in order to increase resources for development . In addition to consultations with the NGOs represented in the Subcommittee , a number of other large NGOs involved in poverty alleviation activities were also contacted to seek their views on the Second Decade .

 This training should be organized in a systematic and ongoing manner and should not be limited to information on the relevant national and international legal provisions . It should include information on , inter alia , the social and other   causes   of juvenile delinquency , psychological and other aspects of the development of children , with special attention to girls and children belonging to minorities or indigenous peoples , the culture and the trends in the world of young people , the dynamics of group activities , and the available measures dealing with children in conflict with the penal law , in particular measures without resorting to judicial proceedings -LRB- see chapter IV , section B , above -RRB- . DATA COLLECTION , EVALUATION AND RESEARCH
 Impact of the implementation of the draft guiding principles on respondents ' work Many respondents believed that understanding the   causes   and consequences of poverty - if reflected in legislation - will allow people living in poverty to determine their own priorities . Most also agreed that the draft guiding principles will strengthen local organizations ' capacities to facilitate this engagement if they are provided training and rights-based education programmes .
 Over the following months , however , there had been a number of unexpected developments : first , the energy and food crises and then , the current financial turmoil . The High-level Event on the Millennium Development Goals had given   cause   for optimism : it had shown that there was still much goodwill among Member States and civil society to undertake new commitments to achieve the Goals . The recent Accra High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness had generated fresh commitments to the reform of development cooperation , as shown by the focus on national ownership and leadership , capacity development and greater accountability .
 Accordingly , the authors were denied a competent and impartial investigation and the possibility of a judicial remedy . 5.4 On alternative remedies , the authors argue drawing on the Committee 's general comment No. 11 that the availability of a civil   cause   of action for defamation , libel or slander is not a substitute for compliance with article 20 requirement that certain advocacy be affirmatively prohibited by law . Nor is the ability to privately engage criminal prosecutions , as occurred in this case , a replacement for the State 's own responsibility to pursue the behaviour at issue .
 2.2 On 20 February 1996 , the author lodged an appeal with the Labour Standards Commission under article 124 of Quebec 's Act on labour standards . He complained that his dismissal was without just and sufficient   cause   and sought reinstatement . He said the Labour Commissioner had refused to exercise jurisdiction with regard to discrimination since that complaint had been made to another court -LRB- see paragraph 2.3 below -RRB- , and the question of discrimination had therefore not been addressed .
 It provided further details about appeals against loss of employment and discrimination under article 124 of the Act on labour standards . This legislative provision allows employees who can show that they have three years of continuous service in the same enterprise and who believe that they have been dismissed without just and sufficient   cause   to submit a complaint , in writing , to the Labour Standards Commission . The Labour Commissioner must assess all the circumstances of each case in order to determine whether the measure taken by the employer was just and fair .
 After 11 days of hearings , the Labour Commissioner found that the weight of evidence supported the conclusion that the author had lost his job as a result of administrative dismissal and not discrimination . He concluded that the author was not the victim of a dismissal without just and sufficient   cause   . 6.2 The State party recalls that the Superior Court also rendered a decision on the question of consideration of the discrimination alleged by the author .
 GIEACPC stated that legal protection from violence and abuse is given by the Law on Violence against Women and the Family -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , the Childhood and Adolescence Code -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , the Criminal Code -LRB- 1991 , amended 2005 -RRB- and the Constitution -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . The Childhood and Adolescence Code prohibits ill-treatment of children , which is defined as âany conduct , any act of omission or commission , that   causes   or may cause harm to the integrity or physical , psychological or sexual health of a child or young person , by any persons , including their parents , other relatives , educators and persons responsible for their care , whatever means used , whatever the consequences and whatever time is necessary for the victim to recoverâ -LRB- article 67 -RRB- . GIEACPC stated that , in the penal system , corporal punishment is unlawful as a sentence for crime under State legislation .
 We are encouraged by the recent improvements in the overall economic performance of our countries as a group , largely driven by improved world commodity prices , growth in traditional and non-traditional exports , improved domestic policies and increased international support measures . While such an improvement is a   cause   for optimism , there is a concern that it has not been accompanied by structural transformation in our economies , implying a high degree of vulnerability to shocks and crises - leading to a sudden collapse in national output , a rise in unemployment and a sharp increase in income poverty . In order for our countries to take advantage of globalization , their vulnerability to shocks and crises should be mitigated through combined national and international measures .
 Reaffirming the need to strengthen the synergy between Africa 's economic and social development programmes and its peace and security agenda , Takes note of the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and welcomes recent institutional developments in addressing such causes and other efforts in conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacekeeping and peacebuilding undertaken by African countries , African regional organizations and the United Nations system ; Welcomes the progress made , in particular by the African Union and the subregional organizations , in the prevention , management and resolution of conflict and in post-conflict peacebuilding in a number of African countries , and calls for intensified efforts and a coordinated approach between national Governments , the African Union , subregional organizations , the United Nations system and partners with a view to achieving further progress towards the goal of a conflict-free Africa ;
 The Committee should build on the momentum and renewed commitment gained during the biennial review of the Global Strategy to complete its work on the draft convention and should not allow itself to be caught up in an ideological polemic , which benefited only terrorists . It was important to evolve clear policies and strategies backed by a solid legal regime that left no room for misclassification of terrorism , which no   cause   or grievance could justify , into tolerable and intolerable categories . Implementing the Global Strategy would call for greater cooperation among States and other actors .
 Rule 8 By-elections If a member of the Commission dies or resigns or for any other   cause   can no longer perform his or her duties , the Meeting of States Parties shall elect a member for the remainder of the predecessor 's term . Such by-elections shall be carried out in accordance with article 76 and Annex II to the Convention .
 Major rebel groups continue to be intransigent and are boycotting the negotiating process . China is deeply worried. We solemnly call upon those groups to put the overall interests of national stability and the well-being of the people of Darfur above everything else , to respond positively to the just   cause   of the international community and to make the right choice at an early date . The Security Council should also invest more energy in its efforts to facilitate the political process in Darfur .
 Causes of audit issues Failure to comply with prescribed UNOPS regulations or lack of compliance with standard rules and procedures is the main   cause   -LRB- 43 per cent -RRB- of the audit issues addressed in the 2007 audit report . The other main causes are inadequate or lack of supervision by supervisor -LRB- 31 per cent -RRB- ; absence of written procedures to guide staff in performing their functions -LRB- 17 per cent -RRB- ; human error -LRB- 4 per cent -RRB- ; and insufficient resources -LRB- 3 per cent -RRB- .

The 2008 audit plan will focus on each of these significant areas .
 The long-term health consequences for the victims include sexually transmitted infection such as HIV/AIDS , fistula , early pregnancy and debilitating psychological trauma . Sexual violence in times of conflict , in particular against children , constitutes the breaking of deep social taboos in every culture and as such   causes   maximum devastation to the social fabric of communities . Therefore , the interventions required in the aftermath of widespread and systematic sexual violence necessitates more comprehensive approaches that begin with the victims but extend to the communities in which they must once again find their place and comfort .
 The origins of climate change have been conclusively proven , both through real-life experiences and by science . These   causes   have been internationally accepted and are uncontested . Solutions to avert this catastrophe have been continually elaborated and agreed upon .
 Statements in explanation of vote after the vote The representative of the United Kingdom , supported by Romania , stated that , although a number of members in the Committee might disagree with the philosophies of particular organizations , that was no   cause   for their exclusion . Organizations such as COC Nederland deserved equal rights with others to engage in the work of the United Nations .
 Indeed , in the Caribbean it is the tourism industry that influences the significant movement of labour from the rural areas , attracting women and youth in particular , in search of more productive employment in the service industries . The increased migration of labour to cities and coasts is both a symptom and a   cause   of sluggish rural development . Recent contractions in the agrarian sector , due mainly to the loss of preferences , falling commodity prices , and natural disasters , have also contributed to this demographic shift .
 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa , and welcoming the partnership established between the United Nations and the Economic Community of Central African States for that purpose ,
 Subprogramme 2 Health 25.2 -LRB- a -RRB- Reduced infant and maternal mortality from preventable   causes   related to pregnancy and childbirth , with special emphasis on reduction of neonatal mortality . UNRWA made progress on increasing the rate of early registration of pregnant women for prenatal care .
 Further , for the MDGs to be effective over the long term , developing countries must take ownership of the Goals . At the midway point of MDG implementation , for Papua New Guinea , we believe there is   cause   for cautious optimism . Papua New Guinea celebrated 33 years of unbroken constitutional democracy on 16 September this year .
 While income and human development poverty focus on individuals , implying deprivation owing to lack of income or failure to achieve a certain level of human development , social exclusion focuses on social relations , thereby implying deprivation because of membership of a certain social group whose interaction with other groups causes that deprivation . The relevant issues , then , concern the nature and   causes   of the disruption of social bonds , inability of the group to participate in society , the discrimination they faced , or the denial of their rights within the existing legal system . The independent expert noted that , at key international events such as the Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development or in the Millennium Declaration , the international community affirmed that poverty was not limited to economic deprivation but entailed social , cultural and political deprivation as well .

 There were also recommendations to launch an African green revolution and improve both economic and political governance through the increasingly effective African Peer Review Mechanism , an innovation that is recognized for creating an enabling environment in matters of governance and accountability . The Secretary-General 's report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa points out that Africa has made sustained efforts to promote peace , deepen its commitment to democratic processes and good governance over the past 10 years . The African Union 's Peace and Security Council and other structures at the regional level are playing an increasing role in mediating disputes between and within African countries .
 As is well known , our Organization was born in response to the horrors that afflicted the world during the years of the Second World War . And even though that war and the transatlantic slave trade were separated by 150 years , the underlying   causes   of those two historic events are very similar . Here we are referring to a perverted concept that claims that one group is allegedly superior to another .
 The depths of their humanity , the unyielding core of their spiritual home , have become the wellspring of our undying vision of a peaceful world that is at once hopeful , diverse , tolerant and forward looking â essential elements that must underpin the future in order to ensure the survival of humankind . Last year , in order to help inculcate in future generations knowledge about the   causes   , consequences and lessons of slavery , as well as to inform of the dangers of racism and prejudice , the sixty-second session of the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/122 , designating 25 March as an annual International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade . Our watchword must forever be , lest we forget .
 We acknowledge the words of a Moroccan researcher , who said : âThe   causes   of tension and conflict are not cultural differences , as long as they are simply value systems and visions for the world and for lifestyles . Instead , they are hegemony and the wish to dominate.â
 My delegation aligns itself with the statements made by the representatives of Kenya on behalf of the African Group and of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . My delegation wishes to make its statement on the two major issues being considered within this cluster : progress in implementation and international support of NEPAD and the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa . Allow me to present our perspectives on both issues .
 The Working Group , composed of eminent experts representing the major legal systems and/or regions of the world as well as observers from international organizations and arbitration centres , including the UNCITRAL secretariat , held its first session in Rome from 29 May to 1 June 2006 , and its second session in Rome from 4 to 8 June 2007 . On the basis of a preliminary study prepared by the Unidroit Secretariat , and in-depth discussion by the Group , rapporteurs for each of the five topics suggested for inclusion in the new edition of the Principles -LRB- unwinding of failed contracts ; illegality ; plurality of obligors and of obligees ; conditions ; and termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   -RRB- were requested to prepare preliminary draft rules together with explanatory notes on their respective topics for discussion at the Group 's next session in May 2008 . C. International carriage of goods
 The Commission heard a statement on behalf of Unidroit , reporting on progress with a number of projects outlined in document A/CN.9/628 and Add.1 , including the following : -LRB- a -RRB- The Working Group on the Principles of International Commercial Contracts held its second session in June 2007 and made substantial progress on the unwinding of failed contracts , plurality of obligors and of obligees , termination of long-term contracts for just   cause   and initial progress on illegality. An intersessional meeting of a drafting committee would be held ; -LRB- b -RRB- The fourth session of the Unidroit Committee of Governmental Experts was held in May 2007 to further consider the draft Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities .
 I feel a very close and personal relationship with this body and with all of you personally . I am looking forward to the opportunity to describe what we are doing in the United States , and importantly , to address the questions that you may have about our programmes , and look forward to that dialogue as we advance our joint   cause   here today . I understand that the Conference has recently adopted an agenda that includes seven items , two of which have direct bearing on the presentation that I will be giving you today .
 Upon contemplation of the issue of a deportation order , the deportee must be served with a notice containing the reasons for his proposed deportation . Further , said notice shall require him to show   cause   before a Magistrate in Chambers as to why the order should not be made . The Minister will then consider the Magistrate 's report and decide whether or not to issue the deportation order .
 The Palestinian economy is at the point of total collapse due to the noose-tightening practiced by Israel , the occupying Power , forcing many Palestinian families to live hand to mouth , barely surviving and deprived of the minimum necessities of a dignified life and of infrastructure , education and health services . The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories , the Gaza Strip in particular , is the   cause   of increasing social and economic suffering among Palestinians because the continuous military operations of the occupier against the occupied territories rely also on the weapons of forcible land seizure , the demolition of homes , the razing of agricultural lands , the imposition of harsh restrictions on transportation and movement , and the policy of closures , which is deemed to be the principal cause of the poverty and humanitarian crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories . Israel has thereby completely flouted all international and humanitarian laws , norms and values , human rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in time of war .
 -LRB- a -RRB- Pursue an internationally agreed definition of what constitutes aid , including the concessionality of financing ; -LRB- b -RRB- Assess on a regular basis the scale of âmulti-bilateralâ aid , its underlying   causes   and whether it is as successful as core multilateral aid in achieving the intended development results ; -LRB- c -RRB- Conduct periodic analysis of emergency aid and aid provided through civil society organizations in the North and the South ;
 Thus , Nietzsche determined that fanaticism was the only strength of will of which the weak are capable . A number of leaders pointed out here yesterday that religion was not the   cause   of violence , specifically terrorism , but rather the pretext of those who corrupt the faith of their peoples for political ends . In that way , they claim that it is only the end , not the means that matters , trying to obscure the fact that the means determine the end .
 We note with appreciation a growing awareness of the importance of dialogue locally , regionally and internationally ; but we also see that such dialogue can be fruitful only if all parties keep it honest , credible and noble . In order for our dialogue to remain balanced and fruitful , we must support and activate international organizations and exert greater efforts to deal with the   causes   of tension and strife , including the elimination of poverty and marginalization through a new momentum for the mechanisms of cooperation among States , such as the World Solidarity Fund , established by General Assembly resolution 57/265 in 2002 . The 2005 World Summit called for its activation so that it could help in combating poverty , thereby eliminating the growing gap among nations and the deepening sense of frustration and exclusion .
 His delegation deeply regretted that no Advisory Committee report on the Development Account had so far been made available , believing that discussion of that matter should not be separated from the overall discussion of development . In addition , it wished to emphasize the importance of the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- , and to draw attention to the conclusions in the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/63/212 -RRB- . The proposals of the Secretary-General were an important step in the right direction , considering the multiplication of the Organization 's mandates .

 In addition , and based on the progress noted to date , UNFIP estimates that approximately 70 per cent of the outstanding projects will be closed by the end of 2008 . Consequently , UNFIP has addressed the   causes   of delinquent report submissions . Department responsible : The United Nations Fund for International Partnerships
 Consequently , with a total of 570 narrative reports due as at the end of 2007 , UNFIP received 447 reports -LRB- 79 per cent -RRB- prior to the deadline , 81 reports -LRB- 14 per cent -RRB- are not required/due , as they pertain to planning grants , and the balance of 42 reports -LRB- or 7 per cent -RRB- were not received by the deadline . Consequently , UNFIP has addressed the   causes   for the delays/non-submission of narrative reports . Department responsible : The United Nations Fund for International Partnerships
 4.15 The State party recalls that the complainant has claimed that he was persecuted by Ukrainian Security Services because of his refusal to share the results of his inquiry in relation to the alleged murder of the Mayor of Kmelnitsky . It notes that the complainant has not explained either to the Swiss asylum authorities or in his communication to the Committee why and how he was able to conduct a scientific inquiry on the   causes   and the results and consequences of the accident . The State party expresses surprise at the fact that , given the time elapsed , the complainant never substantiated his allegations earlier , either by specifying the reasons for his inquiry , by indicating the names and the qualifications of the specialists consulted , or by producing the results of his inquiry .
 Ms. Mambetali -LRB- Kyrgyzstan -RRB- , responding to the question on conformity of the nationality legislation to article 9 of the Convention , said that the general rule was that a child born in the territory of Kyrgyzstan was a citizen of the country and enjoyed its legal protection . He or she could not be extradited or deported to another country or stripped of his or her nationality without due   cause   . Only in the event of disputes arising from the fact that one parent was a citizen of another country or when both parents were foreign nationals or stateless persons did the need for agreement between the two parents arise .
 In fashioning rules for the protection of persons in a process of codification and progressive development , the need for protection was equally compelling in all situations , taking into account their complexity . Moreover , it was not always easy to maintain distinctions between different   causes   and contexts or as regards duration . However , the Special Rapporteur readily accepted that such a holistic approach would not encompass armed conflict per se within the scope of the topic .
 One has publicly declared her HIV status and is now a regional AIDS ambassador . The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Samoa is low , a true blessing when compared to other developing countries , but that is no   cause   for complacency . AIDS is an emerging issue , and if it is not contained or eliminated successfully , it could undermine our Government 's attempt to address poverty alleviation and other Millennium Development Goals .
 Two years ago , my delegation joined many here in this Hall to issue support for the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS . In that document we recognized that , in many parts of the world , the spread of AIDS is a   cause   and consequence of poverty , and that effectively combating HIV/AIDS is essential to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals . We also acknowledged that , for the first time in history , we have the means to reverse the global epidemic and to avert millions of needless deaths .
 In 2004 , more than 14 , 000 Africans lost their lives as a result of armed conflicts . While the   causes   of conflicts are diverse in nature , they all adversely affect the development process . They generally result in population displacement and the disruption of public services .
 Expanding those options of risk management has received greater attention from the policy community in recent years . However , managing risk does not exhaust the insecurity challenge , owing to the fact that , for many of the events that threaten downside losses , the   causes   are more systemic in nature , and the outcomes can be catastrophic . Such events are much more difficult to predict and to cope with .
 The mandate for establishing the outreach programme was assigned to the Department of Public Information , which defines its goals as follows : -LRB- a -RRB- To impress upon civil society the importance and necessity of educating future generations about the   causes   , consequences and lessons of the slave trade and to communicate the dangers of racism and prejudice ; -LRB- b -RRB- To encourage educational institutions to incorporate into their academic programmes , curricula and discussions , the subject of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade , the contributions made by enslaved Africans to civilization , the legacy of the slave trade on contemporary society and the dangers of racism and prejudice ;
 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa , and welcoming the partnership established between the United Nations and the Economic Community of Central African States for that purpose ,
 Reiterates its request contained in resolution 61/19 of 28 November 2006 for Member States that have not already done so to develop educational programmes , including through school curricula , designed to educate and inculcate in future generations an understanding of the lessons , history and consequences of slavery and the slave trade ; Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the programme of outreach on the transatlantic slave trade and slavery , which highlights developments relating to a diverse educational outreach strategy to increase awareness of and to educate future generations about the   causes   , consequences , lessons and legacy of the four-hundred-year-long slave trade and to communicate the dangers of racism and prejudice , and encourages continued action in this regard ; Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session on continued action to implement the programme of educational outreach , including action by Member States ;
 The report showed that change was occurring at an unprecedented rate and that humanity had yet to turn the corner to sustainable development ; all indicators were pointing to a worsening situation affecting both developed and developing economies . A number of innovations , or âgreen breakthroughsâ , gave   cause   for optimism , however , although they had not yet been scaled up to the point where they could provide a coherent global response . Despite the existence of improved tools , better science , a more informed public and a more proactive private sector , the threshold of sustained action was yet to be crossed .
 We take note of the Secretary-General 's progress report on the implementation of the recommendations on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/63/212 -RRB- . The   causes   of conflict in Africa are many . They include extreme poverty , weak State institutions , poor management of natural resources , failure to protect fundamental human rights and increased threats related to climate change .
 -LRB- b -RRB- Financial Control Section will request and/or assist field offices to draw up the matrix for the follow-up on external audit recommendations per partner -LRB- UNHCR Manual Chapter 4 , Annex 8.8 Audit Guidelines , Attachment G , December 2004 -RRB- . Where such assessments reveal that there is a valid   cause   to make financial adjustments with implementing partners , the appropriate accounting entries will be booked and follow-up actions will be taken . Such assessments will also be used to further improve the implementing partner audit processes .

 At the same time , however , the continued presence of military personnel of the Sudanese Armed Forces -LRB- SAF -RRB- and the Sudan People 's Liberation Army -LRB- SPLA -RRB- around the oilfields and other areas along the disputed 1956 borderline remained a source of tension , as each side continued to dispute certain military positions held by the other . Clashes over migration routes and grazing rights in Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Abyei , which were addressed in my last report , continued to be the   cause   of considerable unrest . A road accident on 7 February in Balom , 28 kilometres north of Abyei , involving an SAF truck and vehicles carrying the Commissioner for Abiemnom and his escort ended in a firefight between SPLA and local Misseriya tribal militia , injuring several people .
 The effects of such breaches can manifest in many forms , including as loss of marine habitats , loss of species and reduced fish catch , coral bleaching and decreased biodiversity , and can thus directly impact the social and economic interests of coastal States . This can lead to direct conflict , or exacerbate other   causes   of conflict , such as poverty , migration , infectious diseases , poor governance and declining economic productivity . Not every breach may lead to a threat to maritime security , however , intentional and unlawful damage to the marine environment can be of such a scale that it threatens the security of one or more States -LRB- see also para. 307 below -RRB- .
 Rule 10 In accordance with article 72 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , if a member of the Committee dies or resigns or declares for any other   cause   that he or she can no longer perform his or her duties as a member of the Committee , the Secretary-General shall immediately request the State party that nominated the expert to appoint within two months another expert from among its own nationals for the remaining part of the term . The new appointment is subject to the approval of the Committee .
 We need to defend the values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the sixtieth anniversary of which we commemorate tomorrow . The United Nations has a responsibility to lead the international community 's efforts to confront this menace , which no   cause   or grievance can justify . As a universal organization , with independent and impartial standing , the United Nations is uniquely placed to play that role .
 It is time for the world to take notice . We are not the   cause   of the problem of terrorism ; we are its victims . We are an aggrieved nation , not one that has caused grief .
 The OAS also promotes cooperation in our region through multilateral peace efforts and the joint fight against international terrorism . The uncontrolled spread and inappropriate use of small arms and light weapons   cause   great harm , both in terms of human lives and in their negative impact on security and development conditions . The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects monopolizes significant resources that could be invested in development .
 The obligation with respect to those activities is precisely spelled out in the substantive draft articles . Such activities are those that are carried out just above or close to an aquifer or aquifer system and   cause   or may cause some adverse effects on it . There must , of course , be causal link between the activities and the effects .
 In that context , I can only hope that my Palestinian colleague 's poignant outcry against the deliberate killing of children , describing it as sinking into the abyss , was really directed at the Hamas terrorists he again somehow failed to mention by name . Let us be very clear : while for Israel every dead Palestinian child is a horrible mistake and a tragedy , for the terrorists , every dead Israeli child is a victory and a   cause   for celebration . Allow me to briefly turn to the situation along our northern border .
 9.3 A major barrier to the development of Africa has been the persistence of conflicts in certain countries of the region . The need to develop a comprehensive means of promoting peace and security and development has long been recognized and was articulated in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . Since the issuance of that report , in 1998 , a number of United Nations initiatives in Africa have been in line with the recommendations of the report , although a great deal still needs to be done .

 The period for which a defendant who is remanded in custody may be detained is governed by custody time limits which limit the time which may elapse between first appearance and start of trial to 56 -LRB- or in certain cases 70 -RRB- days for cases being tried summarily , and to a total of 182 days for cases tried on indictment . The limits may be extended by the court on application , provided there is a good and sufficient   cause   for so doing and that the prosecution has shown all due diligence and expedition . When the custody time limit expires , the defendant must be released on bail .
 The Ministers expressed their deep concern at the sharp rise in global food prices and underline that the global food crisis poses a serious challenge to the fight against poverty and hunger , as well as to the efforts by developing countries to attain food security and achieve the objectives of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015 and other internationally agreed development goals , including MDGs . They reiterated that the global food crisis has multiple and complex   causes   and that its consequences requires a comprehensive , coordinated and sustained response in the short , medium , and long-term by the international community and national governments . They also emphasized the need for global mechanisms to serve as an early warning system on food security to prevent the recurrence of food crises .
 Article 28 If , within the period of time fixed by the arbitral tribunal , the claimant has failed to communicate its statement of claim without showing sufficient   cause   for such failure , the arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings , unless the respondent has submitted a counter-claim . If , within the period of time fixed by the arbitral tribunal , the respondent has failed to communicate its statement of defence without showing sufficient cause for such failure , the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings continue , without treating such failure in itself as an admission of the claimant 's allegations .

Remarks
 That there exists such an absolute right has been maintained by many a writer . Thus , for instance , Oppenheim maintains that a State can expel every alien according to discretion , and that the expulsion of an alien without just   cause   can not constitute a legal wrong . It would be difficult to find a confirmation of this view in the practice of international tribunals which have been frequently called upon to adjudicate claims for wrongful and indiscriminate expulsion .
 The arbitrary action of a State may occur in relation to the decision to expel a particular alien , the procedure followed in the adoption of the decision or the manner in which the expulsion decision is implemented . âThus arbitrary action , either in the choice of the individual expelled , or in the method of expulsion , would indicate an abuse of power and point to internationally illegal action â¦ As a matter of fact , arbitrariness in the methods applied in the particular case , rather than in the choice of the individual concerned or in the determination to expel him , usually constitutes the chief   cause   of foreign complaint , and is commonly an element to be found in the cases where the conduct of the territorial sovereign is subjected to sharpest criticism.â The discretionary nature of the right of a State to expel aliens may make it difficult to establish the arbitrary character of an expulsion .
 In the Boffolo Case , the requirement of a valid ground for expulsion was also affirmed . The Umpire , while recognizing the existence of âa general power to expel foreigners , at least for   cause   , â indicated that âexpulsion should only be resorted to in extreme instances.â The need for good cause or justification was also mentioned in the arbitral award that was delivered in the Tacna Arica Question : âHow many of these formal or informal expulsions were based on good cause it is impossible to say on the record presented , but it is reasonable to conclude that aside from the conscription cases there were also other cases in which justification could not successfully be established.â

 âThe Committee â¦ stresses that recent reports on the human rights situation in Mexico have concluded that although efforts have been made to eliminate torture , many cases of torture are still reported . However , in line with the reasoning previously advanced , although it might be possible to assert that there still exists in Mexico a pattern of human rights violations , that in itself would not constitute sufficient   cause   for finding that the complainant was likely to be subjected to torture on his return to Mexico ; additional reasons must exist indicating that the complainant would be personally at risk. -LSB- â¦ -RSB- âThe Committee also takes note of , and attaches due weight to , the evidence and arguments put forward by the complainant concerning his personal risk of being subjected to torture : the fact that he has been arrested and tortured in the past because he was suspected of having links with EZLN ; the scars he continues to bear as a result of acts of torture which he suffered ; the fact that the conflict between the Mexican Government and the Zapatista movement is not yet over and that some members of his family are still missing .
 A warship with all persons and goods on board , remains under the jurisdiction of her flag-state even during her stay in foreign waters . No legal proceedings can be taken against her either for recovery of possession , or for damages for collision , or for a salvage reward , or for any other   cause   . No official of the littoral state is allowed to board the vessel without special permission of the commander â¦ Even individuals who do not belong to the crew but who , after having committed a crime on the territory of the littoral state , have taken refuge on board , can not be forcibly taken off the vessel ; if the commander refuses their surrender , it can be obtained only by diplomatic means from his home state .

 âIn principle , the alien is entitled to treatment no less favourable than the ` minimum standard ' required by international law .

 In 1964 , after an incident involving the expulsion of United Kingdom citizens from Tanzania , the view was expressed in Parliament that there was in fact no obligation to give reasons for deportation , although here they seem to have been apparent from the circumstances of the case . It is important that a requirement to give precise reasons should not be confused with an over-all requirement that expulsion should be based on `reasonable   cause   ' . This may appear to be only a matter of detail , but it gives substance to both the obligation not to proceed in an arbitrary manner and the right to judge reasons of `ordre public ' in the light of national criteria.â Guy S.

 peace and sustainable development in Africa Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa Progress report of the Secretary-General
 Introduction The progress made in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the 1998 report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- has been monitored and reported to the General Assembly since 2000 . The present report , which responds to Assembly resolution 60/223 of 23 December 2005 , should be read together with the Secretary-General 's fourth consolidated report on progress in implementation of and international support for the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- A/61/212 -RRB- , which monitors the implementation of recommendations related to economic and social development in Africa .
 Between June 2005 and June 2006 , the Security Council deliberated on potential or actual threats to peace and security in Burundi , Chad , the Central African Republic , CÃ´te d'Ivoire , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Guinea-Bissau , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Somalia , the Sudan and Western Sahara , as well as on subregional and cross-border issues in the Great Lakes region . The underlying   causes   of conflict in Africa were identified in the Secretary-General 's 1998 report . Disaggregating these causes into enabling factors , mobilizing factors and triggering events as well as root causes of conflict may further enhance understanding of conflict dynamics .
 Often , these issues are only loosely connected to the original underlying grievances but the promoters of conflict exploit such factors in an effort to mobilize youth and win over domestic and international public opinion , turning them into formidable obstacles to peace . Finally , immediate   causes   or triggers are factors that affect the timing and onset of the violent outbreak but are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain it . Analytical research on the specific causes of conflict in each situation is needed to improve the effectiveness of conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding efforts , including the work that will be undertaken by the newly established Peacebuilding Commission .
 Conclusions and recommendations There has been steady progress in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . While Africa has seen a significant decline in the number of areas experiencing conflict and violence over the last few years , new crises with the potential to grow into major conflicts have arisen within the reporting period and there are old crises bearing the same potential .

 Audit reports issued January to December 2005  Causes   of audit issues As illustrated in figure 3 , analysis of the causes of audit issues indicated that the most common -LRB- 43 per cent -RRB- is lack of compliance to pertinent regulations , rules , procedures and guidelines .
 Causes of audit issues As illustrated in figure 3 , analysis of the   causes   of audit issues indicated that the most common -LRB- 43 per cent -RRB- is lack of compliance to pertinent regulations , rules , procedures and guidelines . The other main cause -LRB- 31 per cent -RRB- was lack of guidance in respect of operational procedures .
 It is also well settled that serious violations of international humanitarian law entail individual criminal responsibility . As underscored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , âwar crimes and crimes against humanity may be committed even by those who believe , accurately or not , that their combat is a just one and their   cause   a worthy pursuitâ . She adds : âWhenâ¦ legal obligations regulating the conduct of hostilities are violated , personal criminal responsibility may ensue , particularly for those in position of command and controlâ .
 He said that today 's poverty is the lasting legacy of colonialism , and a most important cause of terrorism . He also suggested that the draft principles and guidelines should await completion of a study on the economic   causes   of terrorism . Ms. Hampson noted that paragraph 28 of the Chairperson 's draft text does mention the causes of terrorism .
 Tobacco is the second cause of death in the world and the fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide . It is the   cause   of 4.9 million deaths a year , which is equivalent to 1 in 10 adult deaths globally . The figures are even more alarming when considering that future projections estimate that the number will nearly double by 2020 .
 Israel continued to claim legitimate defence as justification for its actions . Yet , legitimate defence and proportionality were linked ; the former was a   cause   for justification while the latter was an element of the former . If acts of legitimate defence were excessive , they were no longer legitimate and therefore Israel could not justify its continued harsh policies against the unarmed civilian population .
 The return to peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will , we are sure , allow a qualitative step towards the definitive stabilization of the Great Lakes region . The recent developments , with the success of the referendum on the constitution and the good preparations for the general elections on 30 June , are   cause   for real optimism . Here I wish to point out the symbolic value of the date chosen for the elections .
 Mr. Dos Santos -LRB- Mozambique -RRB- said that continuing terrorist attacks around the world were a standing reminder that terrorism remained one of the most serious threats to international peace and security . There was no   cause   or grievance that could justify terrorist acts . As a clear demonstration of its political will , Mozambique had already acceded to or ratified 12 of the major international conventions on terrorism , and he was pleased to report that his Government had recently signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and was now in the process of ratifying it .
 Persons detained on grounds of having engaged in a terrorist act may not be transferred by one State to another State except under legally recognized extradition , expulsion or deportation procedures that fully conform with all international human rights and humanitarian rules . Transfers of persons detained on grounds of having engaged in a terrorist act should not be carried out when there is reasonable   cause   to believe that a request for transfer is motivated by prejudice , discrimination or other impermissible bias or when there is any reason to believe that the person for whom the transfer is sought would not have a fair trial in conformity with all rules of international law relating to the administration of justice , or would be subjected to conditions of detention that fully meet all international standards . In particular , States sending a person should affirm that there are no unjustifiable exceptions , limitations or derogations in place in the receiving State .
 All rules relating to privacy and property rights shall be in strict conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law norms . States shall not encroach , either electronically or by any other means , on correspondence or other private communications , without warrants issued with sufficient   cause   . Property may not be seized as part of counter-terrorism measures without warrants issued on the basis of sufficient cause .

 These are not new provisions , as stated in the report , but amendments aimed primarily at introducing transparency to the activities of non-governmental organizations and increasing their responsibility for the strict discharge of their statutory functions . As for the question of fines , it should be pointed out that such measures are not new â they already feature in Uzbek legislation â and , second , that non-governmental organizations that carry out their activities in accordance with their statutes and existing national legislation have no   cause   for concern . The âgrave concernâ expressed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders with regard to these amendments is groundless , since the State is entitled to use legal mechanisms against those who infringe the law , with a view to maintaining the supremacy of the law as understood in accordance with international standards rather than by applying some arbitrary interpretation .
 Recalling the general principle of the protection of the civilian population against the effects of hostilities , Deeply concerned at the fact that after the end of hostilities , people continue to be killed or injured by unexploded and abandoned explosive ordnance which have ceased to have any military purpose , and that such explosive remnants of war still remain for decades a   cause   of humanitarian suffering , a daily threat to civilians and military alike , an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , a serious impediment to humanitarian assistance , peace-keeping , post-conflict reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions , Recalling that the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War -LRB- Protocol V -RRB- was negotiated by the CCW Group of Governmental Experts in 2001and 2003 and was adopted on 28 November 2003 at the Meeting of the States parties to the CCW held in Geneva on 27 and 28 November 2003 ,
 Section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Namibian Extradition Act , Act No.11 of 1996 deals with mandatory refusal of extradition on the basis that the offence in question is an offence of a political nature . It is common   cause   that the political offence exception in extradition law is a principle that exists in most jurisdictions , however the problem is that no acceptable definition of what constitutes a political offence has been determined in these jurisdictions . So far our courts have never dealt with this principle and there is no criteria that has been set to determine what constitutes a political offence .
 The causes of the 2 , 547 NGO/NEX audit issues identified were : lack of compliance ; guidelines ; guidance ; human error ; and lack of resources . The   causes   are presented in table 4 -LRB- see Annex 6 -LRB- d -RRB- for definitions -RRB- . Table 4 , opposite , shows that the main causes of the audit issues , across all regions , were lack of compliance and lack of guidance .
 Table 4 , opposite , shows that the main causes of the audit issues , across all regions , were lack of compliance and lack of guidance . OAPR highlighted the possible   causes   of the audit issues in the NGO/NEX evaluation letters issued to the resident representatives , and requested that project and country office management immediately address these causes by submitting management comments to OAPR in the form of an action plan indicating the corrective actions and implementation of audit recommendations -LRB- see annex 7 -RRB- . In addition , through the RASCs and workshop conferences , OAPR is undertaking a campaign in increasing awareness of these issues .
 The Government was indeed seeking to determine the causes of the problem . As the report indicated , it was not possible to pinpoint a single   cause   , as multiple factors were involved , including the economic situation and the persistence of a patriarchal culture and unequal power relationships between men and women . The influence of the media and access to information might also be a factor .
 Permitting the status quo to continue and allowing terrorism to go savagely unchecked are not merely acts of neglect ; they constitute reckless endangerment of the prospects for peace , our regional future and the very foundations of human dignity and right to life . In Lebanon , there is ample   cause   to be optimistic . Now , nearly three months after resolution 1701 -LRB- 2006 -RRB- was adopted by the Council , we have seen positive developments in southern Lebanon .
 Another 2003 study , led by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , found an average of 91 industrial compounds in the blood of nine volunteers who did not work with chemicals on the job or live near an industrial facility . A total of 167 chemicals were found in the group , of which 76 cause cancer in humans or animals , 94 are toxic to the brain and nervous system and 79   cause   birth defects or abnormal development . The dangers of exposure to these chemicals in combination have never been studied .
 This requirement must be taken into account in the grant of employment-based benefits and in the setting of obligations on employees . The requirement of equal treatment may only be derogated from when there is an acceptable   cause   for derogation deriving from the duties and position of the employees . The requirement of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination are applied in connection with the recruitment of employees , during employment and in the termination of employment .

Under the Employment Contracts Act , the conditions of work applied to fixed-term and part-time employment must not be less favourable than those applicable to other types of employment merely because of the duration of the employment contract or working hours , without proper and justified   cause   . It is further provided in section 2 that the definition of discrimination , prohibition on sanctions and burden of proof in cases concerning discrimination are laid down in the Non-Discrimination Act -LRB- 21/2004 -RRB- .
 The reports by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Latvia on the fulfilment of their stockpile destruction obligations is yet another step forward . In addition , the fulfilment of article 5 obligations by Guatemala and Suriname gives us further   cause   to be optimistic that universalization will soon be achieved . The recent successes on the Mine Ban Convention should not , however , make us complacent .
 Suggested JIU standards : Selection on the basis of widely publicised vacancy announcement and competitive process ; Appointment and removal with the prior consultation/approval of the governing body ; Removal for just   cause   ; Fixed tenure up to a maximum of five to seven years , with no expectation of any employment within the same agency at the end of the term . Annex VI
 Any one of these factors is enough to increase an individual or community 's susceptibility to HIV infection . To have many of the factors present within one population group signals clear   cause   for concern about the impact of the HIV epidemic on indigenous populations and highlights the challenges faced in trying to reduce its spread within such communities . Examples of strategies , policies and initiatives focused on HIV in indigenous populations
 Lack of technical education also has an effect , since behavioural changes , including consumption patterns , can not be made without knowledge of the challenges and options for reducing CO2 emissions . -LRB- b -RRB- Women and men perceive the   cause   of climate change -LRB- including CO2 emissions -RRB- differently . In Germany , more than 50 per cent of women , compared to only 40 per cent of men , rate climate change brought about by global warming as extremely or very dangerous .
 That kind of senseless slaughter of innocents reinforces the urgency with which we should be united and resolute in confronting terrorism everywhere and at all levels . We must also firmly reject the notion that any   cause   can justify terrorism . Nothing can ever justify the targeted killing of innocent men , women and children .
 To note with concern , however , that Guatemala has reported consumption of methyl bromide for 2005 of 522.792 ODP-tonnes , which is inconsistent with the Party 's commitment contained in decision XV/34 to reduce its methyl bromide consumption to 360 ODP-tonnes in 2005 ; To note further the advice of Guatemala that all relevant stakeholders have committed to phase out methyl bromide in accordance with the revised time-specific consumption reduction benchmarks contained in paragraph 5 of the present decision , which provide the Party with one additional year to overcome the technical , economic and political challenges that were the   cause   of the Party 's deviation from its commitments contained in decision XV/34 ; To note also with appreciation that Guatemala has submitted a revised plan of action for methyl bromide phase-out in controlled uses and to note , without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol , that under the revised plan Guatemala specifically commits itself :

 Although terrorism , security , high oil prices and regional and national strife posed many challenges to Governments , markets and citizens alike , macroeconomic and political situations were largely stable . Some development-oriented processes , such as the Kyoto Protocol talks and the Doha trade negotiation process , may have failed to bring tangible progress in areas such as environmental sustainability and international trade , but in the field of ICT for development there is   cause   for optimism . While the digital divide has a long way to go before it is bridged , over the past 25 years there has been a positive movement to connect the previously unconnected .
 Enforcement of human rights instruments by courts and other authorities Generally , for an individual to found a direct   cause   of action on rights protected by international human rights instruments , the right needs to be incorporated into domestic statute law . Where the wording of a statue permits , the Courts will interpret the statute in a way that is consistent with , and gives effect to , international law .
 -LSB- All members of Permanent and Observation Missions are invited to attend. -RSB- Introduction of two reports of the Secretary-General entitled âThe New Partnership for Africa 's Development : fourth consolidated report on progress in implementation and international supportâ -LRB- A/61/212 -RRB- and âImplementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ -LRB- A/61/213 -RRB- ; and launching of the report entitled âThe contribution of the private sector to the implementation of NEPADâ -LRB- organized by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa -RRB- Thursday , 5 October 2006 , from 1.15 to 2.30 p.m. in Conference Room 6 .
 Contrary to the suggestion of the Advisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD , these efforts should not be lumped together with those of the developed countries , either in calculations of volume of aid moving to Africa or in monitoring such aid . The Secretary-General 's most recent report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/61/213 -RRB- describes recent conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities in Africa . India has been one of the oldest , largest and most consistent contributors to United Nations peacekeeping organizations , having participated in almost every major operation since the inception of peacekeeping in the 1950s .
 The Egyptian delegation wishes to stress once again the special importance of the annual report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict in Africa , which has previously included a consolidated and unique view of the achievements made and the threats and challenges facing the realization of peace and security on the continent . While the focus of the report this year is on the issue of improving political and economic governance as one of the important elements of conflict prevention and peacemaking , we need to avoid addressing the responsibilities and   causes   of conflict in Africa exclusively through the issue of governance . We must give parallel attention to addressing the multidimensional aspects of peace and security and their close and mutual linkage to sustainable development in Africa and the resolution of its political problems , which occupy more than 60 per cent of the agenda of the Security Council .
 At the same time , such progress should not divert us from another essential element of work â to which my country is totally committed â which is to continue our efforts to eliminate all conflicts completely , as that is the sole prerequisite by which we may , on an ongoing basis , remain committed to the path that leads to development . In the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict in Africa -LRB- A/61/213 -RRB- , poverty , inequality and poor governance are identified as the major causes of conflict situations on the continent . Thus , establishing conditions for stability and sustainable peace in Africa also means addressing the challenges of development and eradicating poverty , which often feeds conflicts .
 The State guarantees the right to free choice of work.â The Constitution of Costa Rica also guarantees full and productive employment of the population in two articles : article 63 protects against unfair dismissal , as follows : Workers removed without a fair   cause   shall be entitled to compensation unless they are covered by unemployment insurance . To complement this , article 72 guarantees that âUntil unemployment insurance is established , the State shall maintain a permanent technical system of protection for those involuntarily unemployed and shall strive to restore them to employment.â
 Notwithstanding the concerted efforts of the international community , it was on the increase all over the world . No terrorist act or systematic attacks on civilian populations could be justified for any   cause   whatsoever . His Government condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations committed by whomever and wherever , but it believed that the exercise of the legitimate rights of States , peoples and individuals under international law should not be regarded as terrorism .

 Such a definition is necessary not only to capture the most positive elements of the concept of strict liability as they are obtained in different jurisdictions . Such an approach would not only make the international standard widely acceptable but also ensure the standard adopted truly serves the   cause   of the victims exposed to dangerous activities thus facilitating prompt and effective remedies . -LRB- 18 -RRB- This task can be approached in different ways .
 It had also called for more resources to be mobilized and devoted to affordable housing to meet slum challenges . Another   cause   for guarded optimism was the promulgation by the Secretary-General of the special annex for the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations , which had come into force on 1 August 2006 , and would further strengthen UN-Habitat and its ability to fulfil a catalytic role in attaining the slum upgrading and water and sanitation targets of the United Nations Millennium Declaration . The United Nations had placed the focus of the Human Settlements Foundation 's work thus far on policy guidance , technical assistance , global monitoring and advocacy , but the long-awaited revised rules and regulations would provide a key determinant to the effectiveness of its action : the ability to invest , and provide support in the key area of affordable housing finance .
 Such requests are restricted to cases where a third instance review is justified because , for example , it would contribute to the evolution of the law or to the standardization of the application of the law or it would raise a substantial legal issue . 8.2 When the Supreme Court finds that there is   cause   for review and if it has the necessary data and facts , it hands down a new decision that partly or fully invalidates the decision of the Court of the second instance . Otherwise , when the Supreme Court lacks the necessary data and facts , it remands the case back to the Court of the first or second instance for new proceedings and a decision .
 The question of arms control is of the utmost importance and an urgent task facing the international community . It would , however , be important to point out that while the dangerous and destabilizing arms build-up in various regions of the world presents grave threat to regional and global peace and security and exacerbates tensions , it is not the   cause   but the result of such tensions . The causes of the arms race are of fundamental significance .
 Recent estimates show that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow across almost all regions . Although improvements in treatment effectiveness and prevention efforts are   cause   for guarded optimism , there are now more people living with HIV and AIDS than ever before - 40.3 million . Country results indicate that UNDP has continued to intensify capacity development efforts and build momentum at all levels of government and civil society to effectively respond to the epidemic .
 The election of the six additional members of the Committee shall be held on the occasion of regular elections , in accordance with the relevant provisions of this article . If a member of the Committee dies or resigns or declares that for any other   cause   she or he can no longer perform her or his duties , the State Party which nominated the member shall appoint another expert possessing the qualifications and meeting the requirements set out in the relevant provisions of this article , to serve for the remainder of the term . The Committee shall establish its own rules of procedure .
 What I do know is that the Council will continue to work , ably helped by my successor , on these and many other crises . But there is no   cause   for despair , either . While change for the worse is often dramatic , change for the better is generally incremental .
 However , downside risks from inflationary pressures , high and volatile oil prices and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances continued to exist . Widening income inequality between developed and developing countries and increased protectionism due to the collapse of the Doha Round were added   causes   for concern . The twin challenges currently facing the international community were how to mitigate the specific downside risks that could dampen medium-term growth prospects and how to leverage the benign growth scenario to promote the broader development agenda .
 We appreciate the Security Council 's acknowledgment of the Sheba'a farms problem . We hope that the Security Council and the Secretary-General will , in the period ahead , take the necessary steps to resolve that issue , thereby removing one of the underlying   causes   of the conflict . I am sure that Council members understand that the Lebanese are eager to see a true cessation of hostilities and expect a strong determination on the Council 's part to bring it about immediately .
 Article 7 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Equal Treatment Act contains a general exemption possibility which may be applied to any case occurring under the scope of this Act . `The requirement of equal treatment shall not be violated by discriminatory behaviour or action for which , according to an objective assessment , there is a reasonable   cause   that is directly related to the given legal relationship . ' In addition to the general reasons for exemption the Equal Treatment Act offers special exemption options aligned to the specific features of the branch concerned .
 South Africa : * draft resolution Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa The General Assembly ,
 Underlining the need to address the negative implications of the illegal exploitation of natural resources in all its aspects on peace , security and development in Africa , and underlining also that the illicit trade in natural resources is a matter of serious international concern , which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflicts and the illicit trade in and proliferation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , Takes note of the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , including recent efforts in conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacekeeping and peacebuilding undertaken by African countries , African regional organizations and the United Nations system ; Welcomes the steady progress in the prevention , management and resolution of conflict and in post-conflict peacebuilding in a number of African countries ;
 Mr. Gayama -LRB- Congo -RRB- -LRB- spoke in French -RRB- : Mr. President , I am grateful to you for giving the Council once again an opportunity to examine the situation in the Middle East , 11 days after the adoption of resolution 1701 -LRB- 2006 -RRB- . A review of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 1701 -LRB- 2006 -RRB- for the period 11 to 17 August 2006 -LRB- S/2006/670 -RRB- shows genuine   cause   for hope , overshadowed , unfortunately , by recent developments in the field â notably , serious violations of the cessation of hostilities that was decided on 14 August . While thanking Under-Secretary-General Ibrahim Gambari for his report on the prevailing situation in the field , we can not fail to consider the magnitude of the tasks that remain to be undertaken , not only by the actors but also by the international community .
 Rationale It has become a tradition in the international community to dedicate each year to a particular issue or   cause   with the aim of raising public awareness about the matter . In September 2005 , the General Assembly received midterm reports from more than 600 civil society organizations on progress under the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace , encouraging the strengthening and expansion of activities aimed at building a culture of peace in the world , especially in the remaining five years of the decade .
 As currently worded , the provision would seem to be sufficiently broad to leave it for the prudent discretion of the courts or arbitrators to decide which of the mandatory provisions in other conventions âspecifically provideâ for the carrier 's liability , limitation of liability or time for suit , and should thus prevail over the draft convention . âThis Convention does not establish a direct   cause   of action by the shipper , the consignee , or any other person against -LSB- any person other than a carrier or a maritime performing party -RSB- -LSB- a non-maritime performing party -RSB- .â It is submitted that the addition of a provision that expressly limits direct actions under the draft convention to actions between the contractual parties to the maritime contract of carriage and to actions against the maritime performing party -LRB- thus preserving the application of other mandatory law , if any , to the relations between the carrier and the non-maritime performing parties -RRB- might address remaining concerns about the potential conflicts with other conventions that have been identified earlier -LRB- see A/CN.9/WG.III/WP.29 , paras .
 A major step towards solving the problem of domestic violence was taken by the Ministry of Internal Affairs with its initiative on amending the Ukrainian Code of Administrative Offences , to introduce liability clauses for the commission of domestic violence or the failure to comply with injunctions , which provides the legal and organizational underpinnings for measures to prevent domestic violence . Domestic violence in Ukraine is viewed as one of the fundamental   causes   of homelessness , drug addiction and alcoholism . More often than not , the victims of violence are women .
 Those measures will remain a priority of the Kimberley Process until the problem is resolved . Of course , other efforts aimed at resolving the CÃ´te d'Ivoire conflict must be intensified , especially as diamonds are not the   cause   of the conflict . I wish to commend the Government of Liberia for its strong determination to meet the requirements of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme .
 One year later , what have we accomplished , and how can that progress be assessed in the light of these criteria : the reality of the situation , and the way in which the complex international situation and the never-ending future are evolving ? When we look at the current situation , we have to see that areas of shadow coexist with reasons for hope , and we have some   cause   for concern . More than ever , the Middle East is the centre of deep political , military , socio-economic and cultural tensions , with military confrontation on Lebanese lands and bombings in northern Israel , to mention only the most recent examples .
 On the contrary , it will only exacerbate and prolong the status quo . Morocco is equally convinced that peace in the region can be achieved only if the United Nations creates the right environment and works to eradicate the   causes   of tension and escalation and coordinates regional and international efforts aimed at reviving the peace process on all tracks , with a view to ultimately achieving security and lasting peace . In that way , the peoples of the region would be able to move towards a more promising future in which generations to come can cooperate and live together in harmony .
 Achieving a decisive victory over terrorism will require not only that we deny all financial support to terrorists , but also that we address the origins of extremist thought and the conditions in which terrorists prosper . If we address the feelings of despair , anger and frustration experienced by peoples when they are denied their legitimate rights , we will deprive extremists of their   causes   and rallying cries . As one of the main targets of terrorism , the Kingdom has repeatedly denounced terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has achieved tangible success in combating it .
 -LRB- a -RRB- New Partnership for Africa 's Development : progress in implementation and international support : draft resolution -LRB- A/61/L.23/Rev.1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB-   Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa : draft resolution -LRB- A/61/L.41/Rev.1 -RRB- The General Assembly resumed its consideration of agenda item 62 .
 4.2 Resolution No. 6338 , which declared the author redundant and terminated his employment as of 6 September 1991 , was in keeping with the legal framework governing the reorganization of the customs service and respected the principle of the hierarchy of norms , which was : article 211 of the Constitution ; Supreme Decree No. 043-91-EF of 14 March 1991 concerning the reorganization of the National Customs Authority ; and National Customs Authority resolution No. 002412 of 4 April 1991 establishing the criteria to be used for declaring that the Authority was overstaffed . 4.3 While article 48 of the Constitution , which was invoked by the author , guarantees the right to security of employment , it also points out that a worker can be dismissed for just   cause   provided in the law and duly proven . In the present case , there was just cause for dismissing the author , since he was terminated due to reorganization .
 Prisoners subject to unlawful treatment may seek relief like any other person aggrieved by action of a public official . Whether the author could have produced sufficient evidence for an action for breach of duty of care by a prison officer or Governor , who may only be sued for damages if his action was both malicious and without reasonable and probable   cause   , was doubtful in view of the considerable evidence from various prison officers , welfare officers , medical officers and nurses . However , lack of evidence on the author 's part was immaterial to the question of whether effective remedies were available .
 5.3 The author argues that the State party failed to rebut the expert advice he produced on the limited availability of civil remedies submitted by him . Legal action based on a breach of duty of care , under section 263 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , of the Crimes -LRB- Administration of Sentences -RRB- Act 1999 -LRB- NSW -RRB- , would require -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the author 's treatment was malicious , which is difficult to establish , as most of the impugned measures are permitted under domestic law ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that it was without reasonable and probable   cause   ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that harm or injury be established . Any course of action requiring damage to be established would be futile , given that the psychiatrist was unable to determine the exact nature of any damage caused to the author as a result of his treatment .
 Thus , instead of negotiating multilateral disarmament agreements , the Conference has been trying to forge consensus on current disarmament priorities . Over the years , the impasse has been attributed to a number of   causes   , including differing views concerning the agenda , the rules of procedure , the decision-making process , the informal system of political groups , the composition and the lack of involvement of civil society , and so on and so forth . Potential remedies have not had the desired effect .
 Fees collected from households might provide a domestic source of financing environmental programmes , under the âpolluter paysâ principle that was already applied to industry . Armed conflicts were also identified as   causes   of marine degradation , both for direct action such as attacks on oil transport systems and for the diversion of resources from environmental management . International assistance in providing a methodology for economic valuation for ecosystem resources and services was also noted as useful , as was an international review of national programmes of action for the effective implementation of the Global Programme of Action .
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . In its resolution 2005/53 , the Commission reiterated and reaffirmed :
 Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Council by 6 June 2006 with an update on the situation in Timor-Leste and the role of the United Nations in Timor-Leste following the expiration of the mandate of UNOTIL with a view to taking further action on the subject ; Encourages the Government and other State institutions of Timor-Leste , with the assistance from UNOTIL within its current mandate , to address the   causes   of the violence in order to prevent a recurrence of such incidents ; Decides to remain actively seized of the matter .
 The Centre continued to offer graduates and researchers in the areas of peace , security and disarmament in Africa places in its internship programme . During the reporting period , interns and researchers were received from the International Relations Institute of Cameroon , conducting research on the status of the implementation in Africa of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on âThe   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ ; from the Georg-August-UniversitÃ¤t , GÃ¶ttingen , Germany , working on the promotion of civil-military relations matters in Africa ; and from the University of LomÃ© also working on civil-military relations matters , with a focus on Togo . The Centre also continued to maintain and improve its website -LRB- www.unrec.org -RRB- .
 Resolution 1625 -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is quite eloquent on that subject . My delegation would therefore like to stress that , while we need to deal with the problem of displaced persons and refugees , special attention should be given to the   causes   of conflict in Africa . We would like to ask Mr. Guterres a few questions for the purpose of clarification .
 -LRB- b -RRB- Appointment should be subject to consultation and prior consent of the governing body ; -LRB- c -RRB- Termination should be for just   cause   , and should be subject to the review and consent of the governing body ; -LRB- d -RRB- A non-renewable tenure of five to seven years should be established , with no expectation of any further employment within the same United Nations organization at the end of the term .
 It was proposed that any provision on carrier liability for delay should include clarification that the carrier would not be liable for loss or damage to the extent that it was attributable to an act or omission of another shipper . That proposal received support although a concern was expressed that such clarification was unnecessary and might be confusing , given that such an exclusion was already encompassed within the general principle contained in draft article 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , which relieved the carrier of all or part of its liability if it proved that âthe   cause   or one of the causes of the loss , damage or delay is not attributable to its fault or to the fault of any person referred to in article 19â . However , it was suggested that as draft article 17 could be subject to differing judicial interpretation which nevertheless found a carrier liable , perhaps for an overall failure to put into place systems to prevent such a delay , the clarification would still be helpful .
 Mr. Tladi -LRB- South Africa -RRB- said that his Government supported the work of the Commission on diplomatic protection , particularly the principle set out in draft article 2 that the right to exercise diplomatic protection under international law was vested in the State . The State was under no obligation in international law to exercise that right , however , and draft article 19 therefore gave   cause   for concern , particularly in view of the commentary , which invoked the possibility of such an obligation . Although it was couched in non-peremptory language , draft article 19 could give the impression that States were required to exercise diplomatic protection and that the nationals concerned had the right to determine the nature of that protection .
 It was also unclear whether the liability to be imposed under draft principle 4 , paragraph 2 , was strict or absolute liability . If strict liability was intended , there was no need to enumerate   causes   of exoneration . It emerged from draft principle 4 , paragraph 5 , that States were residual and subsidiary compensators whose responsibility it was to ensure that adequate compensation was available .

 It therefore seems logical that the question whether a company has ceased to exist , and is no longer able to function as a corporate entity , must be determined by the law of the State in which it is incorporated . -LRB- 7 -RRB- The final phrase âfor a reason unrelated to the injuryâ aims to ensure that the State of nationality of the shareholders will not be permitted to bring proceedings in respect of the injury to the corporation that is the   cause   of the corporation 's demise . This , according to draft article 10 , is the continuing right of the State of nationality of the corporation .
 Such a definition is necessary not only to capture the most positive elements of the concept of strict liability as they are obtained in different jurisdictions . Such an approach would not only make the international standard widely acceptable but also ensure the standard adopted truly serves the   cause   of the victims exposed to dangerous activities thus facilitating prompt and effective remedies . -LRB- 18 -RRB- This task can be approached in different ways .
 The phenomenon has not spared the Mediterranean region , as evidenced by the attacks carried out in Djerba , Casablanca , Istanbul and Madrid . The fight against this insidious and unpredictable threat which has challenged the world order requires collaborative efforts based on a comprehensive and concerted approach aimed at achieving the total eradication of its   causes   and its various manifestations . The lack of progress towards disarmament at the international and regional levels , together with the refusal of some countries to accede to multilateral non-proliferation conventions , has the potential to affect the climate of confidence and exacerbate the arms race in the region .
 By law , women in Turkmenistan could not be denied employment , have their salaries reduced or be dismissed for reasons of pregnancy or childcare . Should they have   cause   for complaint , they could apply to the courts for compensation in respect of any moral or material damage suffered . The 1999 Law on Petitions of Citizens and Procedure for their Consideration thus served as a major tool in ensuring and protecting their rights .
 The costs of the suspension of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations are high , and the risk could be even higher if the talks do not resume soon . Beyond that , there are important political and systemic implications for the multilateral trading system and the   cause   of multilateralism in general . What we now risk losing is far more significant than the individual issues on which the negotiations have foundered .
 The Committee notes with concern the persistence of patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes regarding the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and society . These stereotypes present a significant impediment to the implementation of the Convention and are a root   cause   of violence against women , as well as of the disadvantaged position of women in a number of areas , including in all sectors of the labour market and in political and public life . The Committee recommends that the State party take measures to bring about changes in traditional patriarchal attitudes and in gender-role stereotyping .
 That philosophy is very dangerous for the Middle East region and the rest of the world . A ceasefire in Lebanon and the resolution of the immediate   causes   of the conflict must be followed by negotiations for a comprehensive peace in the region , if such crises are to be avoided in the future . The President -LRB- spoke in French -RRB- : I now give the floor to the representative of India .
 Our delegation hopes that the Chairperson and our fellow delegates will receive our suggestions this morning in the constructive spirit in which we offer them . As we observed to numerous delegations during our recent consultations with the various regional groups , Member States have ample   cause   for pride in the steps that we have taken in a transparent and consensual manner to improve the effectiveness of the methods of work of the First Committee . Our delegation continues to believe that , in the long term , these procedural innovations will assist delegations in overcoming our differences on the issues of the day so that we can act in concert once again to strengthen international peace and security .
 Our region faces growing threats , stemming from the non-compliance by some States with their international obligations and norms , in particular the ongoing activities of Iran and its total disregard of both the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- Board of Governors and the relevant Security Council resolutions . Under such a title , one could have expected to find , at a minimum ,   cause   for compliance by States in the region with the relevant international obligations or for mutual recognition and peaceful relations among countries of the region . Lamentably , the draft resolution does not reflect the realities of our troubled region .
 Certain specific grounds are provided upon which such applications can be brought before the competent courts of the land . The spouse bringing a divorce   cause   can only do so three years after the celebration of the marriage. This is provided in Section 6 of the Matrimonial Causes Act . Section 8 of the Matrimonial Causes Act lists the following grounds upon which one may bring a divorce action :
 Extradition may not take place if prosecution or enforcement of the penalty under Norwegian law is barred by lapse of time -LRB- Section 9 -RRB- . According to the Extradition Act Section 10 , extradition will be refused if it is not found that there is just and sufficient   cause   for suspecting the person concerned being guilty . Section 12 paragraph 1 stipulates a list of compulsory conditions in respect of extradition .
 The Committee was dismayed to learn that the number of women murder victims during 2005 is similar to the number during 2004 and notes with concern that , while many measures have been adopted , they do not appear to have stemmed the wave of violence against women . Please provide additional information about the characteristics and   causes   of these new cases and specify whether they are different types of cases with different motives . According to information from the Special Office for the Investigation of Murders of Women in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez , Chihuahua , 32 women were murdered in 2005 .
 The election of the six additional members of the Committee shall be held on the occasion of regular elections , in accordance with the relevant provisions of this article . If a member of the Committee dies or resigns or declares that for any other   cause   she or he can no longer perform her or his duties , the State Party which nominated the member shall appoint another expert possessing the qualifications and meeting the requirements set out in the relevant provisions of this article , to serve for the remainder of the term . The Committee shall establish its own rules of procedure .

 AIDS is a development issue . The spread of HIV is both a   cause   and a consequence of poverty . Confronting the epidemic requires stronger action on education , nutrition and child survival .
 The European Union reiterated its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations . There was no   cause   or grievance that could justify terrorist acts . The European Union commended the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy , which demonstrated the resolve of the General Assembly to unite in order to prevent and combat terrorism .
 Stresses the critical importance of a regional approach to conflict prevention , particularly with respect to cross-border issues such as disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , prevention of illegal exploitation of natural resources and trafficking of high-value commodities and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , and emphasizes the central role of the African Union and subregional organizations in addressing such issues ; Welcomes efforts to enhance practical cooperation , within the framework of an effective partnership , between the United Nations and the African Union in the realm of conflict prevention and resolution , crisis management , peacemaking , peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding in Africa , and in this context urges the United Nations system and the international community to increase , coordinate and sustain their efforts aimed at assisting African countries in addressing the full range of   causes   of conflict in Africa ; Stresses the importance of effectively addressing challenges which continue to hamper the achievement of peace and stability on the continent , inter alia , youth unemployment , the devastating social , economic and political impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons ;
 My delegation is very grateful to all of the sponsoring States for their support , and I hope that even more will join us in the coming weeks . The purpose of the CCW is to ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons that   cause   excessive injury or unnecessary suffering to combatants or that affect civilians indiscriminately . This is as pertinent and pressing as ever .
 What measures have been taken in this regard ? Divorce by consent is processed through a notary 's office , and divorce for just   cause   is settled in the People 's Municipal Courts . All disputes arising in the course of divorce proceedings , whether these have been initiated by consent or for just cause , are dealt with by the People 's Municipal Courts as interlocutory matters .
 Divorce by consent is processed through a notary 's office , and divorce for just cause is settled in the People 's Municipal Courts . All disputes arising in the course of divorce proceedings , whether these have been initiated by consent or for just   cause   , are dealt with by the People 's Municipal Courts as interlocutory matters . In 2005 , the Municipal Courts processed a total of 33 , 576 petitions for divorce on grounds of âjust causeâ , as well as 685 post-divorce disputes relating to changes in custody arrangements , contacts between parents and children , and alimony .
 There were 566 cases involving the liquidation of community property . In addition , the proposed amendments to the Family Code improve the institution of divorce , either by consent or for just   cause   . The proposals eliminate the option of granting parental authority to only one parent when a divorce is processed through a notary .
 The Secretary-General 's report makes the essential point that in order to eliminate conflict we need to better understand the underlying causes , the enabling and mobilizing factors or triggers . As identified in 1998 , such   causes   and factors must be specifically researched and analysed for the countries in question if we are to improve conflict prevention , peacemaking , peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding . Much of the information needs to be gathered so that we may be more effective in our actions to avert conflict .
 On the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development , we are anxiously awaiting the day when the Secretary-General 's report on Africa will be fully occupied with economic , financial and development issues , as well as with discussions about science , technological advancement and economic competitiveness , making no mention of conflict . In 1998 the Secretary-General first submitted his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- . In paragraph 2 of that report , he stated âAfrica as a whole has begun to make significant economic and political progress in recent years , but in many parts of the continent progress remains threatened or impeded by conflict.â
 We would like to thank the Secretary-General for his three reports on the items we are discussing today , namely , the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries , Particularly in Africa ; the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- ; and the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . First , I shall discuss the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of sustainable peace and development in Africa . Our experience in the Sudan has shown us the necessity of addressing the critical economic and developmental dimensions of conflicts as well as the vital role of improving the socio-economic conditions of people in achieving sustainable peace .
 For this reason , Ireland joins others in urging all space-faring States to consider the many useful transparency and other confidence-building measures that have been proposed here and elsewhere , including most recently by the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission chaired by Dr. Hans Blix . In particular we are attracted to suggestions that States should be encouraged to provide advance notice of all space launches ; that States should declare unilaterally that they will not fight-test or deploy weapons in outer space ; that they should declare moratoria on the production and testing of anti-satellite weapons that   cause   debris in orbit ; and that active consideration should be given to establishing , by code of conduct or otherwise , a requirement to observe minimum exclusion zones around satellites in orbit and other space safety rules . We believe that these measures would significantly enhance confidence among States in the continuing peaceful use of outer space to the benefit of all .
 We should therefore consider whether this cause of invalidity of an international treaty could be applied , mutatis mutandis , to a unilateral act . In Sicault 's view , both fraud and error are   causes   of invalidity that are fully applicable to unilateral acts . The reference to both causes is probably due to the fine line between them , which has been illustrated on several occasions in the legal literature .
 The reference to both causes is probably due to the fine line between them , which has been illustrated on several occasions in the legal literature . If this   cause   of invalidity is accepted in the case of unilateral acts , it should be subject to the same conditions required in order for fraud to be taken into consideration in a treaty context . In this connection , it is said that the fraud must be of an essential nature .

 Lastly , the secretariat should be encouraged to continue its ground-breaking , critical and in-depth analysis of African development , which should inform its policy advice and technical assistance programmes in the relevant areas , so as to facilitate the attainment of the MDGs . The representative of the Republic of Korea observed that there was   cause   for optimism regarding Africa 's development in the light of observed a number of positive developments , such as the recent increases in FDI flows to the continent , revenue gains following an increase in commodity prices and the donor community 's promise to double ODA to Africa by 2010 . In order to play its part fully , the Republic of Korea had pledged to share its development experience with Africa and had proclaimed 2006 the âyear of Africaâ .
 That is their declared aim , and that is what we are fighting . And while for us every dead Lebanese child is a horrible mistake and a tragedy , for them every dead Israeli child is a victory and a   cause   for celebration . I am saying emphatically at this table that I would not be surprised , because of their cynicism and brutality and total disregard for human life , if this is exactly what Hizbollah wanted to happen .
 The provisions concerning freezing are contained in the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 202 d requires the authorities to freeze any property belonging to the suspect , any entity owned by the suspect or over which he has control , or any person or entity that acts on behalf of , or at the direction of the suspect , or such entity as mentioned . Accordingly , when a person is suspected with just   cause   of preparing or carrying out an act of terrorism or of financing terrorism , the police authorities shall freeze without undue delay any property belonging to the suspect or such persons or entities mentioned above . Decisions to freeze property are taken by the chief or the deputy chief of the Norwegian Police Security Service , or by a public prosecutor .
 Small arms and light weapons are no small matter , despite their description , because they are a source of disturbance and instability . As Governments have been unable to control or trace them , they remain a scourge and a   cause   of turmoil . Allow me also to thank Ms. Hannelore Hoppe , Officer-in-Charge for the Department for Disarmament Affairs , for having presented the third report of the Secretary-General , which he submitted as part of a series of reports dealing with the illegal traffic in small arms and light weapons .
 -LRB- a -RRB- Secure gender equality and protect women 's human rights Violence against women is both a   cause   and a consequence of discrimination against women and of their inequality and subordination . States have an obligation to respect , protect , promote and fulfil all human rights , including the right of women to be free from discrimination .
 This is all the more necessary in the current international and regional environments , where rapid economic progress is accompanied by the requisite social change . I appeal once again to Senior General Than Shwe , other leaders of the Government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to set aside their differences , to unite for the larger   cause   of national reconciliation and to commence substantive dialogue as soon as possible . It is only through an all-inclusive dialogue that Myanmar will be able to ensure that national reconciliation is durable and the transition to democracy smooth .

 I also wish to commend you , Mr. President , for your selection of the topic under discussion . The issue of small arms requires the urgent attention of the United Nations , as these weapons are used in many of the conflicts around the world and are a   cause   of a very high loss of life , especially of women and children . My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General presented by the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs this morning .
 Ms. Taft : It gives me great pleasure to be able to present some highlights of the role of the United Nations Development Programme as it helps to maintain peace and security in the Central Africa subregion . It is well known that impoverishment can be a   cause   and a consequence of conflict . Unstable situations thwart development efforts .

 Although the principle of warning civilians by itself is of value , the effect of provisions on warning will accumulate if dealt with in a broader , integrated context -LRB- especially in the context of provisions for facilitating clearance -RRB- . In a process aimed at introducing warning provisions and raising awareness of the danger of UXO in a civilian population , there are a number of important factors to be considered : first , the range and nature of the different types of UXO that   cause   civilian casualties ; second , the social and economic factors present in populations affected by these weapons ; third , existing best practice in this area ; and fourth , the technical and other information required to enable the provision of warnings . This paper also briefly considers existing measures in international humanitarian law .
 Mr. Negroponte -LRB- United States of America -RRB- : Today , the Security Council meets again to consider the situation in the Middle East . When many of us left New York for Monterrey for the International Conference on Financing for Development just over two weeks ago , there was   cause   for guarded optimism . The Security Council had just passed resolution 1397 -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , Crown Prince Abdullah had begun to lay out his bold vision for peace , and both parties had welcomed General Zinni 's return to the region .
 Pakistan had successfully cleared all minefields after the three wars in that part of the continent and no humanitarian situation had been caused by the use of landmines . It was committed to ensuring that the mines in its military inventory would never be the   cause   of civilian casualties in Pakistan or elsewhere . Pakistan had also developed significant expertise in mine clearance and was involved in a number of United Nations-sponsored demining operations around the world .
 As a member of the Special Committee , Fiji makes an important contribution to the work of the Committee and is a steadfast and respected voice in promoting the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples . Fiji 's principled support for the   cause   of decolonization is also made evident given the presence of its Minister for Foreign Affairs at this ceremony and by the fact that this is the second time in four years that Fiji hosts a Pacific regional seminar . I wish , therefore , on behalf of the members of the Committee , to reiterate our tribute to the Government and people of Fiji for their profound commitment to the cause of decolonization and , more generally , to the fundamental principles of justice , equal rights and self-determination of peoples which the United Nations has pledged to uphold .
 We are aware of the difficulties involved in your coming here and we appreciate the effort you have made and are looking forward to hearing your presentations regarding your Territories . And to all of those of you who are well known to us , we also express our appreciation and gratitude for the valuable information you bring to our Committee and for your perseverance and commitment to the   cause   of decolonization . Appendix V
 The Conference adopted a definitive programme of action covering the period up to 2005 , and included a request to the WTO Director-General to submit by the end of 2002 a progress report on the implementation of the programme of action . Since the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly his report entitled âThe   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- , the international community has devoted special attention to African issues , ranging from peacemaking , post-conflict peace-building and sustainable growth and development , to mobilizing resources for Africa 's development . In that context , we highly appreciate and value the Secretary-General 's efforts and initiatives aimed at ending conflicts , building peace and alleviating the suffering inflicted on Africa by such conflicts .
 There are many causes for this failure ; it is up to us to remedy it . With NEPAD , we now have an instrument , a strategy and a   cause   . It is up to the African countries to provide it with substance , to promote democracy and fulfil the explicit proposal to work together .
 A strategy should manifest the reasons for expecting that producing outputs x and y will lead to result z. RBB does not require that strategies be included in the programme budget , but making them explicit in the programme design phase can be useful in identifying strengths and weaknesses and in making adjustments in the design . A sound strategy will ensure a higher degree of probability that the   cause   and effect relationship between the outputs and the expected results will hold trueâ ; Acknowledges the importance of the MTP and stresses the relationship between the programme budget and the MTP : âThe requirements for defining objectives will in due course also apply to the Medium Term Plan -LRB- MTP -RRB- , the difference being the time-frame ; Objectives for the biennium will therefore be derived , from and serve as a component in achieving , the objectives of the MTP . Objectives for the biennium and for the MTP should show a difference in what is to be accomplished in two and four years respectivelyâ ; Gives very precise instructions for establishing performance indicators to measure results , for measuring the quality of outputs and , collecting and presenting data , etc .
 They live as refugees or under foreign occupation , or both . These realities are cause for deep regret , but they must also be   cause   for urgent action and involvement . Palestinian children have learned that the existence of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on children is important , but only if those instruments are implemented .
 As Africa embarks on the road of peace , we wish to underscore the crucial role played by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development , the Economic Community of West African States and the Southern African Development Community in their relentless search for negotiated settlement of the conflicts in our respective subregions . There is   cause   for optimism , and it is gratifying that the days of doom and gloom for Africa are on their way to extinction . Our region , the Indian Ocean , which has witnessed some turbulent times recently , is again poised for stability and development .
 -LRB- a -RRB- The joint development by OHCHR , UNDP and OAS of a cooperation strategy that relies more on quality than quantity , and in which priority is given to redressing the balance in favour of : Professionals who , through their professionalism , respect for the law and independence of mind , give good   cause   for thinking that they will be players in the future ; Active members of civil society -LRB- NGOs , the press , etc. -RRB- who , in a transitional period - especially during a crisis - act as a vital opposition force ;
 History was made as the East Timorese marked the birth of their country â the first independent nation of the new millennium . This is a   cause   for celebration for the people of that country , who have shown such courage and determination in pursuing their goal , but it is also an occasion to recall the long and painful road that took them to nationhood â a road which required many difficult decisions and severe sacrifices . It is an occasion to remember those East Timorese who dreamed of this day , but did not live to see it happen .

 But its rejection by Chairman Arafat and the subsequent wave of Palestinian terror that continues to this day have led many Israelis to conclude that the Palestinian leadership is not interested in the creation of a Palestinian State . After many months of ongoing violence and terrorism in the Middle East , we once again have   cause   for hope . Although one would never know it from listening to some of our deliberations here in New York , there have been a number of positive developments in the last several days .
 The Palestinian Observer apparently believes that the premeditated murder of innocent civilians , including women and children , is acceptable so long as it is committed in the West Bank or Gaza . He would be well served to bear in mind the words of the Secretary-General before the General Assembly on 1 October 2001 : âThere can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life , regardless of   cause   or grievanceâ -LRB- see A/56/PV.12 , p. 3 -RRB- . In the light of the Palestinian position , Israel is left with no choice but to continue to take the measures necessary to protect its citizens from the constant threat of terrorist activity .
 In the case of a promise the same comment could apply . A unilateral act whereby a State undertakes to assume a particular conduct in the future may be invalid if the author State invokes a   cause   of invalidity . In the case of a protest , the issue could be approached from a different angle .
 We must also refer briefly to another aspect related to invalidity , the treatment of which is also based on the Vienna regime : domestic law concerning competence to formulate unilateral acts and the particular restriction of the power to express will . According to the Vienna regime , an act may be invalid if it is formulated in violation of a provision of domestic law concerning competence to formulate such acts , but this   cause   may be invoked only if the violation is manifest and if it concerns a norm of fundamental importance to the domestic law of the State . Although the first issue seems applicable to unilateral acts , the second presents difficulties .
 Lastly , it is noted that , as regards form , criticisms were expressed regarding the presentation of the causes of invalidity in a single draft article in the third report of the Special Rapporteur , as opposed to the formulation in the Vienna regime where articles 46 to 53 contain separate provisions for each cause . The new presentation of the   causes   in separate provisions makes it necessary to introduce the requisite changes . The new draft articles may serve as a basis for discussion in the Working Group which will have to be set up during this session .
 If this alternative is accepted it might also be desirable to reflect just as expressly in the definition in article 1 , the possibility of a collective unilateral act referred to in the said draft article as the unequivocal expression of will of âone or more Statesâ or of âone or more other Statesâ . Another possibility would be to explain in the commentaries being prepared on article 1 , that it relates to unilateral acts which may have an individual or collective origin and that this , in the context of article 5 , may enable one of the author States to invoke the   cause   of invalidity . The new wording specifies that it is possible to invoke a defect in âthe expression of willâ and absolute invalidity if the act conflicts with a peremptory norm of international law or jus cogens and if it is a result of coercion of the person formulating it on behalf of the State .
 -LRB- a -RRB- The Registrar shall establish a Property Survey Board , to render written advice to her/him in respect of loss , damage or other discrepancy regarding the property of the Court . The Registrar shall establish the composition and terms of reference of the Board , which shall include procedures for determining the   cause   of such loss , damage or other discrepancy , the disposal action in accordance with rule 110.27 , and the degree of responsibility , if any , attaching to any Court official or other party for such loss , damage or other discrepancy . -LRB- b -RRB- Where the advice of the Board is required , no final action in respect of the loss , damage or other discrepancy may be taken before such advice is received .
 Creating fear , inflicting violence and attacking innocents were long ago declared invalid instruments for the attainment of political goals ; such actions have long been delegitimized in inter-State conduct and , today , even in intra-State conflicts . These constitute a definition of âterrorismâ and there is no   cause   or ideology or religion that can be invoked in its justification . The Treaty of Westphalia gave us the concept of State sovereignty more than three centuries ago .
 There is , therefore , a need to make a concerted efforts to prevent conflicts from breaking out in the first place . Such efforts should take cognizance of the fact that   causes   of conflict are multidimensional . The Secretary-General 's report offers invaluable insights in this regard â that the responsibility lies with national governments to adopt equitable public policies and to ensure adherence to international humanitarian and human rights standards , and for such efforts to be supported by the United Nations , regional organizations , civil society and the private sector .
 Moreover , the economy and a large proportion of the population remain vulnerable to external shocks . The capacities and reach of public administration and civil society organizations must be strengthened to deal effectively with many broader development challenges facing Somalia , ranging from the securing of any sustained peace agreements , to the response to environmental degradation -LRB- a   cause   of subsidiary conflicts in the country -RRB- . The achievement of peace and stability is therefore of paramount importance .
 â26. We believe that the preparatory process for the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s , scheduled for September 2002 , presents an opportunity for an assessment of the role the United Nations and the international community have played in supporting Africa 's priorities , including a comprehensive review of initiatives on Africa . In considering the final review , the General Assembly should take into account how best to improve the effectiveness of United Nations support for Africa 's priorities and initiatives , bearing in mind the Secretary-General 's 1998 report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We also request the Secretary-General to review the structures charged with follow up at the Secretariat level.â
 I also wish to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Vieira de Mello , my Special Representative , and to all the men and women of UNTAET and its partner organizations . The United Nations has   cause   to be proud of what they have accomplished . Annex
 Some concern was expressed in relation to the inclusion in paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the requirement to show that the debtor had a reasonable prospect of reorganization . It was suggested that paragraph -LRB- 3 -RRB- should include the possibility of sanctions where applications were made without good   cause   . For lack of time the Working Group did not complete its consideration of the revised paragraphs on application and commencement .
 First , we will establish a council on global ethics education for children , consisting of people of faith , educators and others to work in cooperation with the United Nations to help children develop ethical values , faith in the divine and esteem for people of different religions and civilizations . Secondly , we will further strengthen our efforts to eradicate poverty , the root cause of the deteriorating environment that children face , giving attention not only to external   causes   but also to those that stem from the human heart . Thirdly , we will do our utmost to generate a universal moral force for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to mobilize all people in the Global Movement for Children .
 This debate once again underscores the need for closer collaboration between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations â a matter of continuing interest to the Security Council in fulfilling its mandate for the preservation of international peace and security . We believe that the practical steps outlined in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict in Africa could enhance the relationship between the United Nations and the OAU . To this end , Jamaica supports a call for the further strengthening of the United Nations office to the OAU in Addis Ababa .
 This means that within this period , therefore , the 13 weeks maternity leave , plus the 5 weeks extra time , the employer may not terminate a female employee 's employment . Subsection -LRB- 20 -RRB- of Section 34 is of particular importance as it states that when a female employee does not resume work or , if she resigns within six months of resuming work without good or sufficient   cause   , she is bound to pay the employer a sum equivalent to the wages she received during the maternity leave . 11.34 Protection against Dismissal
 The procedure for the freezing of funds , financial assets etc of persons or entities suspected of terrorist activities is identical to that applicable in the case of persons suspected of engaging in money laundering activities . where there is reasonable   cause   to suspect that a person is guilty of a crime liable to the punishment of imprisonment of more than one year , and where a person is charged with any such crime .
 Section 435A of the Maltese Criminal Code further provides that where there is reasonable cause to suspect that a person is guilty of a crime liable to the punishment of imprisonment of more than one year , the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act will apply . By virtue of Section 4 , if the Attorney General has reasonable   cause   to suspect that a person is guilty of such a crime , he may apply to the Criminal Court for an investigation order and/or an attachment order. An attachment order so issued , has the effect of : attaching in the hands of such persons -LRB- hereinafter referred to as `` the garnishees '' -RRB- as are mentioned in the application all moneys and other movable property due or pertaining or belonging to the suspect ;
 All citizens were equal before the law and there was no room for special jurisdiction or courts . Public officials who committed a crime could be tried by an ordinary court under criminal law in the same way as any other citizen and without any further formal requirement , in the case of public officials enjoying exemptions , than a declaration of reasonable   cause   made by the Chamber of Deputies -LRB- lower house -RRB- . As far as civil liability of public officials was concerned , the applicable provisions were those of ordinary law .
 Our tactic was always to fight against fully equipped enemy units . These days you seem to want to label as terrorism any armed resistance , regardless of the legitimate   causes   that may justify it . Applying this logic , you would be quite capable of describing as terrorism the struggle of the American colonists who rebelled and fought against English domination .
 Welcoming the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as a centre for the coordination of all activities of United Nations bodies concerned with small arms , Thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement on small arms made by the President of the Security Council on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations resulting from the meetings of the States of the subregion held at Banjul , Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,
 There was currently no discussion of withdrawing the reservation to article 29 , paragraph 1 . Regarding the questions concerning the Constitution , she said that although Section 2 of the Constitution stated that any law inconsistent with the Constitution was void , Section 13 gave the High Court jurisdiction to uphold legislation that might seem to abrogate a fundamental right if it deemed there was sufficient   cause   . The Domestic Violence Act of 1999 was an example , as it authorized the police to enter premises without a warrant when they had reasonable cause to believe that a person was engaging in violence that would result in injury or death .
 United Nations forces should be able to defend themselves and all mission components under more robust rules of engagement ; that would not be the same as the enforcement of peace , but would include all the peaceful means encompassed in the definition of self-defence under the Charter of the United Nations . Aware of the paramount importance of troop contributions , Poland had joined the ongoing anti-terrorist operations in Afghanistan and continued its long-standing engagement in the Balkans and the Middle East , and it stood ready to continue to contribute to the   cause   of peace and security . Mr. Jalang'o -LRB- Kenya -RRB- noted recent peacekeeping successes in Sierra Leone , Ethiopia/Eritrea and East Timor .
 Third-world countries , especially countries of Africa , set great store by this . In Africa , we would like to root out the   causes   of poverty . We have already grasped the different aspects of the situation and decided upon a framework to guide us in this long struggle against poverty , namely the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- .
 The delegation of the Central African Republic fervently calls for the worldwide support of the international community for the implementation of the plan . The many challenges defined at the Millennium Summit in terms of goals to be attained , along with the new plan for African development , will have no chance of success unless they are fostered in an environment of peace , security and stability. However , current conditions do not give much   cause   for optimism , although we note the occasional positive movement towards the settlement of a few conflicts . Regional crises remain , however , that are no less threatening to peace .
 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa , and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa ,
 One of the merits of the final report -LRB- S/2002/1146 -RRB- of Ambassador Mahmoud Kassem and his team is that it points to one of the causes â if not the principal cause â of the conflict that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has endured for several years . In truth , one of the   causes   for the Congo 's instability since its independence is that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is sick â sick from its mineral riches . It is their victim .
 The General Assembly , Having considered the progress report of the Secretary-General entitled âImplementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ , Recalling its resolutions 53/92 of 7 December 1998 , 54/234 of 22 December 1999 , 55/217 of 21 December 2000 and 56/37 of 4 December 2001 on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ,
 It is a well-known fact that the substantial decline in investment flows to developing countries was a result of a series of financial crises occurring in many regions of the world that nearly brought the collapse of the entire international financial system . Here we shall not take up in detail the   causes   of those crises ; however , numerous studies have shown that some of the causes of the crises involved internal factors , while others related to external factors . Thus the responsibility for them is shared .
 It is imperative that the Council act immediately to force the Governments of Iran , Syria and Lebanon to halt the illegal terrorist activities of Hizbullah . We are at a crucial moment for our region , but once again , because of the resolve and the leadership of the President of the United States and the contribution of the international community , we again have   cause   for hope . The President -LRB- spoke in Russian -RRB- : The Permanent Observer of Palestine has asked for the floor , and I call on him now .
 Of course , the statement of the President of the Security Council of 31 January 2002 contains very interesting recommendations and suggestions that pave the way for the future action of the Working Group . We also believe that the activities of the Group should be part of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General 's report on the   causes   of conflicts and the promotion of sustainable peace and development in Africa . The analysis and the recommendations in that report are still very relevant four years later .
 Mr. Kumalo -LRB- South Africa -RRB- : Allow me , Sir , to begin by thanking you for presiding over this meeting today . It is no accident that this issue has come before you , because your Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani was a Vice-Chairman of the General Assembly 's Open-Ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , and he did us proud even then . I also wish to express my delegation 's appreciation and thanks to Ambassador Koonjul of Mauritius , Chairman of the Security Council 's ad hoc Working Group on Africa , for the terms of reference and other proposals before us and for his commitment to the issues of African peace and development .
 Financial Matters In the case of sufficient or supported evidences of connection between bank accounts and criminal persons or organisation , involved in money laundering , terrorism and other crimes , the penal law empowers the judge -LRB- examining judge or judge of the   cause   -RRB- to order the freezing of the bank accounts and make other forfeitures . In this regard , legal diploma arrangements bellow require : Article 170 of the Criminal Proceeding Code , Article 75 of the Criminal Code , Articles 5 and 27 of Act 19/91 -LRB- on the State Security -RRB- , Article 50 of the Act 3/97 -LRB- on Drugs -RRB- , Act on Money Laundering , which typifies the relevant crimes in the field of its application , ââ¦ manufacture , import or export , trading of arms and explosives , terrorism , extortion , corruption , embezzlement , black-marketing and tax evasionâ .
 18 U.S.C. 922 -LRB- y -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- . It is also , with exceptions , unlawful for any person to transfer a firearm to a person whom they know or have reasonable   cause   to believe has been admitted to the United States on a non-immigrant visa or who is an illegal alien . 18 U.S.C. 922 -LRB- d -RRB- -LRB- 5 -RRB- .
 When a warrant of arrest or summons to appear in accordance with article 58 , paragraph 7 , has been issued for a person by the Pre-Trial Chamber and the person is arrested or served with the summons , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that the person is notified of the provisions of article 61 , paragraph 2 . The Pre-Trial Chamber may hold consultations with the Prosecutor , at the request of the latter or on its own initiative , in order to determine whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges under the conditions set forth in article 61 , paragraph 2 -LRB- b -RRB- . When the person concerned has a counsel known to the Court , the consultations shall be held in the presence of the counsel unless the Pre-Trial Chamber decides otherwise .
 Decision to hold the confirmation hearing in the absence of the person concerned After holding consultations under rules 123 and 124 , the Pre-Trial Chamber shall decide whether there is   cause   to hold a hearing on confirmation of charges in the absence of the person concerned , and in that case , whether the person may be represented by counsel . The Pre-Trial Chamber shall , when appropriate , set a date for the hearing and make the date public .
 The Law has placed credit and financial institutions under the obligation to refrain from executing suspicious financial transactions . Thus , under Article 17 of the Law âOn Prevention of the Laundering of the Proceeds from Crimeâ , credit institutions and financial institutions have the obligation to refrain from conducting a transaction if there is   cause   to suspect that this particular transaction is associated with the laundering or attempted laundering of proceeds of crime . If a credit institution or a financial institution is not able to refrain from conducting a suspicious transaction , or if refraining from the conducting of such a transaction may serve as information which would assist persons involved in the laundering of proceeds of crime to evade liability , the credit institution or financial institution has the right to conduct the transaction and report it to the Control Service after the transaction has been conducted .
 Thus , financial resources and other property and resources , which are in association or have been derived in association with or as the result of terrorism , shall be acknowledged as proceeds of crime and are under the control of the aforementioned Law . Accordingly , financial institutions and credit institutions shall refrain from conducting a transaction if there is   cause   to suspect that this transaction is associated with terrorism . The amendments also provides for clear stated rights of the Control Service to pass a decision to credit and financial institutions to freeze a debit operation of the account or any other transaction of other assets of the client if there are suspicions of his or her association with terrorism in the time period designated in the decision of the Control Service , but only for a period of no longer than 6 months .
 2 -RRB- investigatory operations have been initiated in accordance with the procedures set out in the Investigatory Operations Law . Pursuant to a request from the State Revenue Service , which has been accepted by the Prosecutor - General or a specially authorised prosecutor , the Control Service shall provide the information at its disposal necessary for the examination of the income declarations of State officials , if there is substantiated   cause   for suspicion that the official has provided false information regarding his or her financial circumstances or income . The State Security Establishments
 127.2. a person by judgement of a court has been found guilty of the commission in the Republic of Latvia of an especially serious crime . Alternative status shall not be granted to an asylum seeker if there is   cause   to believe that the asylum seeker : 128.1. before arrival in the Republic of Latvia resided in a country where he or she could have requested and received protection ;
 160.1. if the person is a citizen or the non-citizen of the Republic of Latvia ; 160.2. if the request for extradiction of the person is associated with the intent to start criminal persecution or to punish the person due to the person 's race , religious belief , nationality or political opinion , or there is a sufficient   cause   to regard that the person 's rights could be infringed due to the causes mentioned above ; 160.3. in respect of the person the court judgment has legally come into force in the Republic of Latvia about the criminal offence on which the request for extradiction has been submitted ;
 It would prefer to receive support rather than condemnation from the international community , because it wished fervently to work towards peace , reunification , territorial integrity and normal democratic life , so that it could take its place among the free and modern nations of the world . Ms. Motoc -LRB- Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -RRB- , replying to the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , said it was a well-known fact that the   cause   of the deplorable situation in that country was the aggression on the part of armed groups . She felt , however , the time had come to move towards peace rather than dwell on the past , with a view to seeking the truth and eliminating impunity for the crimes committed .
 The representative of Israel 's statement was full of lies , misinformation and accusations hurled in all directions â except at Israel . We would like to make it clear to States Members of the General Assembly is that the Israeli occupation of Arab territories is the main   cause   of all the tragedies experienced by the region . What the representative of Israel failed to say in his statement is that it was Israel that brought terrorism to the Middle East â perpetrating terrorist acts against millions of Palestinians , Syrians , Lebanese and citizens of other Arab countries .
 All other decisions are subject to a system of leave to appeal . This implies that a bench of three judges has first to decide whether leave to appeal can be granted upon good   cause   being shown . This is only granted where the party can show that the issue is one of general importance to proceedings before the Tribunal or in international law generally .
 The commercial and banking customs and practices prevalent in the market in which they operate ; The unusually high amounts , complexity and atypical modalities of those transactions that have no apparent economic or lawful   cause   ; The multiple or separate amounts that , added together , equal or exceed the equivalent of US $ 10 , 000 ;
 Spousal abuse can entail physical , emotional and sexual abuse , financial exploitation and neglect in a life-long or recent partnership . Medication abuse refers to the misuse of medication and prescriptions , deliberately or accidentally , by not providing needed medication , or by administering medication in dosages that sedate or   cause   bodily harm to the older person . Further specific forms of abuse can also be identified in the scientific literature on the subject :
 The Economic and Social Council , Recalling the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , which was submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly , Recalling also paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 55/217 of 21 December 2000 on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in which the Assembly requested the Economic and Social Council to consider the creation of an ad hoc advisory group on countries emerging from conflict with a view to assessing their humanitarian and economic needs and elaborating a long-term programme of support for implementation that begins with the integration of relief into development ,
 Incalculable harm was produced . No   cause   can be invoked to justify it . Attribution of responsibility for the act to this or that policy of the United States is a cynical and opportunist argument .
 Charges under technical service agreement Santa Fe claims an amount of USD 800 , 000 for certain fees that it says it would have been paid by KDC under a technical service agreement that it alleges was cancelled as a result of Iraq 's invasion and occupation of Kuwait . This technical service agreement , executed on 1 July 1988 by Santa Fe and KDC -LRB- the âservice agreementâ -RRB- , had an indefinite term and could be cancelled at will on 90 days notice , with or without   cause   , by either party . The service agreement was in effect on 2 August 1990 .
 At the moment , such representatives have been named for the Great Lakes region and for West Africa , the latter of which was the subject of a debate during Colombia 's presidency of the Council in August 2001 . The third trend is reflected in the excellent work being carried out by the Security Council Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , which is being led in an exemplary manner by the Ambassador of Mauritius . One of the Group 's accomplishments has been to bring together the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council to focus on their respective management functions relating to strengthening peace in countries emerging from conflict .
 In that regard , Nigeria welcomes the continuing efforts of the United Nations , and especially the personal commitment of the Secretary-General , to solving conflicts and laying the foundation for durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . Taking into account the Secretary-General 's comprehensive report -LRB- A/52/871 -RRB- on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , the world community can no longer feign ignorance of the causes and effects of conflict in Africa . The landmark report , for which we thank the Secretary-General , not only identified the root causes of the conflicts on the continent , it also spelled out the roles that African leaders and the international community , including the United Nations system , can play in solving them .
 We hope that , this time , the international community will meet the challenge . Mr. Cheah -LRB- Malaysia -RRB- : My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General 's progress report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/57/172 -RRB- . We also welcome his reports on the independent evaluation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- -LRB- A/57/156 -RRB- and on the review and implementation of the programme for Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa -LRB- A/57/175 -RRB- .
 Further , its oversight role in matters of development cooperation and humanitarian assistance could have particular value in promoting better integration between the relevant policy and operational dimensions , thereby complementing ongoing work that takes place in the General Assembly and the Security Council . The proposal for the advisory group emerged from the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , 1 which was established to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in the related 1998 report of the Secretary-General -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . The recommendation of the Working Group was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/217 of 21 December 2000 , was debated at the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council in July 2001 and became part of the resulting ministerial declaration on the role of the United Nations in support of the efforts of African countries to achieve sustainable development.2
 In addressing Africa 's conflict , we need not reinvent the wheel . Rather , we should revisit the Secretary-General 's April 1998 report -LRB- S/1998/318 -RRB- on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We should take action to implement the recommendations , some of which have been also endorsed in Security Council resolutions .
 It is very important that there be no duplication . We propose that periodic meetings be held involving the Chairmen of the Security Council Working Group on Africa , the Open-Ended Ad Hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , and the ad hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council on African Countries Emerging from Conflict . The results of these meetings should be duly reported to Member States .
 In that respect , Australia will encourage this during our term on the Economic and Social Council . My second point â and a very welcome one â is that with the growing understanding of the   causes   and cures of conflict , it has to be said that our policy toolbox is fuller than it once was . For example , appreciation of the economic factors sustaining conflicts has enabled a more effective international response to the scourge of conflict diamonds , including through the Kimberley Process , in which Australia is deeply engaged .
 To highlight the point , the review identified six focal areas requiring not only priority â climate change , natural and environmental disasters , freshwater resources , coastal and marine resources , energy and tourism . In the meantime , there has been significant   cause   for concern because recent studies point to a steady decline in environmental quality in small island developing States in all regions . Several participants expressed the view that the report of the Secretary-General did not give enough attention to oceans and small island developing States issues and many speakers urged that oceans , coasts and islands become a central theme of the Summit .
 We are firm in our opposition to all forms of Taiwanese independence activities and will tolerate no attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest of China in any fashion . All acts of Taiwan independence are doomed to failure and our grand   cause   of national reunification will triumph . The President : I now call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea , His Excellency Mr. Choi Sung-hong .
 Many thousands of cases of accidental poisoning result from the inappropriate use of highly toxic pesticide formulations , or their use in locations where protective equipment is unavailable or unused . Chemicals deplete the ozone layer ,   cause   climate change and affect biodiversity . They accumulate in poorly managed stockpiles and waste sites .
 Within both the General Assembly and the Security Council , there has been increasing recognition of the contribution that the Economic and Social Council could make to the effective implementation of conflict prevention and peace-building strategies . The Assembly , based on the report of its Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the   Causes   of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , 5 has called upon the Council to engage in matters relating to conflict prevention and peace-building in Africa , with a view to improving coordination of international support in these areas . The Security Council , at its 4465th meeting , held on 31 January 2002 , in connection with the Council 's consideration of the item entitled âThe situation in Africaâ , reaffirmed the importance of strengthening its cooperation , through greater interaction , with the Economic and Social Council , in accordance with Article 65 of the Charter of the United Nations , 6 in the area of the prevention of armed conflicts , inter alia , in addressing the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems -LRB- see S/PRST/2002/2 -RRB- .
 The extremists are holding the entire population hostage . France has vigorously condemned the recent attacks , which no   cause   can justify . These attacks have also been unconditionally condemned by the Palestinian Authority and Yasser Arafat , its elected President .
 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration , adopted on 8 September 2000 by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations , and especially chapter VII thereof , Bearing in mind the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Welcoming the establishment of the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa with a view to creating a climate of peace and security in the subregion and strengthening the rule of law essential to its development ,
 That ceremony of transition will be the culmination of a tremendous effort carried out by the people of East Timor and by the international community . This has been a successful experience , and it is   cause   for rejoicing on the part of the United Nations . In the difficult times now facing the international community , when violence and unyielding opposition in other regions are posing tremendous challenges for the United Nations â challenges that it must overcome in order to maintain its credibility â world public opinion views East Timor as a success story that has brought to life the goals and aspirations embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .
 The Bank of England issues notices to British banks and financial institutions to ensure that the most up to date information on persons and entities subject to asset freezes is available to them . It is the responsibility of the banks and financial institutions to freeze any suspected funds and notify the Bank of England when they have reasonable   cause   to believe that these assets belong to a designated individual or entity . Since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1390 -LRB- 2002 -RRB- three such notices have been issued .
 The Economic and Social Council , Recalling the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , which was submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly , Recalling also paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 55/217 of 21 December 2000 on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in which the Assembly requested the Economic and Social Council to consider the creation of an ad hoc advisory group on countries emerging from conflict with a view to assessing their humanitarian and economic needs and elaborating a long-term programme of support for implementation that begins with the integration of relief into development ,
 In 1998 , the Criminal Procedure Act was also adopted , which introduced the measure of a ban on approaching a specified place or persons -LRB- Article 195a -RRB- as an alternative measure to prison . The measure can also be passed if   cause   is given for a prison sentence , and there is a danger that the accused will destroy evidence of the crime , influence the witnesses , participants or co-perpetrators or repeat the crime , complete an attempted crime or commit an act by which she or he threatens , and the danger may be prevented by a ban on the accused approaching a specific place or persons . The court decides a suitable distance - distance from a specific place or person that the accused must respect and may not intentionally violate .
 In all countries and subregions where violent conflicts and civil strife prevailed , development suffered a major setback . Indeed , the Secretary-General 's 1998 report -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa identified the causes of conflict in the continent and noted that âAfrica as a whole has begun to make significant economic and political progress in recent years , but in many parts of the continent progress remains threatened or impeded by conflictâ -LRB- para . In response to that report , the General Assembly set up an open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on the Causes of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa , to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained therein. The Working Group met in 2000 and 2001 .
 Under those difficult and dangerous conditions , UNRWA staff members continued to carry out their noble mission , which deserved all available support . The financial predicament of UNRWA was a   cause   for serious concern , and for that reason the international community needed to responsibly approach the fulfillment of its obligations to ensure the functioning of the Agency . Saudi Arabia continued to make its financial contributions and donations for the Palestine refugees and provide other assistance to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people .
 Article 7. Passports are granted to all nationals of the Syrian Arab Republic and to Palestinian refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic who fulfil the related requirements . Article 8. Passports of various types are granted to Syrian nationals and other persons and authorities who apply for them when the Minister of the Interior considers that there is   cause   for granting them passports and in the manner that he deems appropriate . - Please see the response relating to paragraph 2 -LRB- b -RRB- .
 Sexual crimes affect the victim 's physical , psychological and moral integrity , and her marriage to a third party or to the attacker does not repair the damage inflicted upon her . Despite Revision of the General Section of the 1984 Penal Code , such   causes   that leave sexual crimes unpunished remain in force . The notion behind this benefit consists in having the âvictim 's honor preserved/repairedâ through marriage , whether to the defendant or to a third party in certain cases .
 Paragraph 1 adds that the State shall protect the expressions of popular , Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian cultures , as well as those of other groups that participate in the national civilization process . Article 10 of the Temporary Constitutional Provisions Act , establishes that , until the supplementary law referred to in article 7 , I of the Constitution is enforced : II - Arbitrary dismissal without just   cause   is prohibited : b -RRB- in the case of a pregnant employee , from the date that pregnancy is confirmed to five months after childbirth as well . Paragraph 1 establishes that , until such time as the law shall regulate the provisions of article 7 , XIX of the Constitution , the period of paternity leave referred to in that item is of five days .
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . In its resolution 2002/66 , the Commission welcomed the steps undertaken by the Sub-Commission to reform and improve its agenda for the fifty-third session. It reiterated :
 Change of counsel Rule 45 -LRB- H -RRB- of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence stipulates that under exceptional circumstances , at the request of the suspect or accused or his/her counsel , the Chamber may instruct the Registrar to replace an assigned counsel , upon good   cause   have been shown and after having been satisfied that the request was not designed to delay the proceedings . The Board noted that , for the biennium ending 31 December 2001 , 22 lead counsel changes and 24 co-counsel changes had occurred .
 One cause for extreme concern was the case of Aury Sara Marrugo , president of the Cartagena branch of the Oil Workers Trade Union -LRB- USO -RRB- , who , together with his bodyguard , was taken prisoner by AUC paramilitaries and later summarily executed . In this case there are indications of police involvement , giving further   cause   for concern in the wake of the attempt on 15 December 2000 to kill Wilson Borja , president of the National Federation of State Employees -LRB- FENALTRASE -RRB- , for which current and former members of the security forces are also under investigation . Attention should likewise be drawn to the extrajudicial execution of Gustavo Soler Mora , president of the union representing workers at the Drummond Company , the mining and energy sector union known as SINTRAMIENERGETICA , in the department of CÃ©sar on 8 October , six months after the double murder of Valmore Locarno and VÃ­ctor Orcasita , then president and vice-president respectively of the same union , the degree of risk to whom had been assessed under the Ministry of the Interior 's witness protection programme -LRB- see chap. VII , sect. C , below -RRB- .
 Regrettably , this past year has seen a rise in human rights violations , increased poverty and hunger , and indications of the remilitarization of society . The renewed commitment to the agreements exhibited at the Consultative Group meeting held in Washington in February 2002 has , however , given some   cause   for optimism . The commitment of the people and the Government of Guatemala must be redoubled to realize the promise embodied in the 1996 agreements .
 The Administration further pointed out that the prompt payment of claims to troop-contributing countries was dependent on the availability of funds in the peacekeeping account . In chapter 7 , paragraph 1 , of the Contingent-Owned Equipment Manual , mission factors are defined as increments to the reimbursement rates to compensate troop contributors for specific conditions prevailing in the area of responsibility that   cause   unusual wear and tear , shorter life of equipment , increased maintenance costs and/or risk of damage and loss to the equipment . At UNAMSIL , mission factors were included in the reimbursement rates under the letter of assist for the period from 1 November 2000 to 31 March 2001 , as per the amendment dated 8 January 2001 , although neither the original letter of assist nor the first amendment thereto , dated 18 July 2000 , provides for such missions factors .
 That entails an immediate halt to the punitive operations organized by a Member of the United Nations in disregard of the Charter itself ; respect for the symbol of the Palestinian national struggle â President Arafat , whose life is being threatened ; withdrawal by the occupying forces to the positions held prior to September 2000 ; and accelerated peace efforts by all international actors . None of that is   cause   for reservations . As we have in recent times constantly referred to the need for unity in the Council , let us demonstrate the solidarity of the international community even if we know that , unfortunately , Israel will ignore this admonition with total impunity .
 -LRB- i -RRB- The first stage is to identify the individuals or groups whose assets are to be frozen : â¢ The Prime Minister , after consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade , may make an interim designation if there is good   cause   to suspect that an organization or group has committed terrorist acts or is an associated entity ; â¢ The Prime Minister can make a final designation if he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that an entity is a terrorist entity or associated entity. This designation expires after five years unless earlier confirmed by the High Court or revoked ;
 Considering that it is not possible to combat racism and racial discrimination , struggle against impunity or denounce the human rights violations which persist in the world without taking account of the deep wounds of the past , Believing that , in the framework of the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , it was necessary that the international community should consider the   causes   and consequences of those ills which , historically , have been brought about largely by slavery , colonialism and wars of conquest , Believing also that the historic responsibility of the relevant Powers towards the peoples whom they colonized or reduced to slavery should be the subject of solemn and formal recognition and reparation ,
 The United Nations deserves credit for consistently presenting the case of Africa in global forums and maintaining it on the international agenda . This Panel also commends the United Nations for its initiatives in the critical area of peace and security , particularly following the Secretary-General 's landmark 1998 report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . The report contained many recommendations related to every aspect of conflict , direct and indirect , and progress has been made in implementing some of them .
 To provide the Secretary-General and , if requested , the General Assembly with such a comprehensive picture of the situation in Africa , the Special Adviser on Africa could prepare an overview of the interrelated dimensions of peace , security and development . Such an overview could build on several foundations : the report mentioned above ; the collective effort of the United Nations system to be prepared by ECA working with the United Nations agencies ; the well-established ECA annual Economic Report on Africa ; as well as the report that was established following the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . Regularly updated statistical tables should accompany such a synthesis .
 Argentine legislation : a dismissal is deemed to be due to reasons of maternity or pregnancy , unless proved otherwise , if it occurs within seven and a half months before or after the birth , provided that the worker gives reliable notice of her pregnancy and attaches a medical certificate stating the probable date of the birth . If the dismissal occurs within these time limits and the employer can not prove that it is due to some other   cause   , he is punished by having to pay special compensation equal to one year 's remuneration , which is added to the standard penalty for arbitrary dismissal . This means that dismissal by reason of pregnancy is punished , and that this provision covers pregnancy , maternity leave and return to work , in accordance with the proposed amendment to the Convention .

 Within the framework of South-South cooperation , China will further intensify its cooperation with Africa and provide genuine assistance to the best of its abilities so as to make its own contribution to peace and development in Africa . Mr. Aboul Gheit -LRB- Egypt -RRB- -LRB- spoke in Arabic -RRB- : Allow me at the outset to express our thanks and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , as well as his report on the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s -LRB- UN-NADAF -RRB- . I have the honour to speak on these two issues on behalf of the African Group of States .
 Mr. Andjaba -LRB- Namibia -RRB- : My delegation associates itself with the statement just made by the Ambassador of Egypt on behalf of the African Group . We welcome the joint debate on the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/57/172 -RRB- and on the final review and appraisal of the implementation of United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s -LRB- A/57/156 and Corr.1 -RRB- . We commend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in mobilizing the international community to support Africa .
 There is no doubt that , with a renewed sense of partnership and solidarity with Africa , that continent will move progressively on the road towards sustainable growth and development . Mr. Shinde -LRB- India -RRB- : We thank the Secretary-General for the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report to the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We also thank him for the reports which have been prepared for the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s .
 Welcoming the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as a centre for the coordination of all activities of United Nations bodies concerned with small arms , Thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement made by the President of the Security Council on small arms on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations resulting from the meetings of the States of the subregion held at Banjul , Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,
 Uganda implemented an extensive literature review on orphans followed by a field survey of 326 households with orphans in eight districts and a study of gaps in care . HIV/AIDS was the leading   cause   of children being orphaned . Considerable resources are available , but they reach only a small proportion of households in need .
 This figure had increased to almost 1.3 billion by 2000 , and assuming no change in global prevalence , the global number of smokers is expected to reach 1.7 billion in the year 2020 . Along with HIV/AIDS , cigarette smoking is the largest growing   cause   of death in the world . According to the forthcoming World Health Report 2002 , currently , an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year are caused by tobacco , and the figure is expected to rise to about 8.4 million in 2020 , resulting in about 1 in 8 deaths.1 Of these deaths , 70 per cent will occur in developing countries , where cigarette smoking was once rare .
 While overall quantities of mercury traded -LRB- and mined -RRB- have diminished in recent years , significant amounts are still transported . The unabated demand in many developing nations is particular   cause   for concern . -LRB- a -RRB- Mining of mercury -LRB- extracted from ores within the earth 's crust -RRB- , either as the main product or as a by-product of mining and refining other metals -LRB- gold , zinc -RRB- or minerals ;
 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa , and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa ,
 -LRB- a -RRB- The Registrar shall establish a Property Survey Board , to render written advice to her/him in respect of loss , damage or other discrepancy regarding the property of the Court . The Registrar shall establish the composition and terms of reference of the Board , which shall include procedures for determining the   cause   of such loss , damage or other discrepancy , the disposal action in accordance with rule 110.27 , and the degree of responsibility , if any , attaching to any Court official or other party for such loss , damage or other discrepancy . -LRB- b -RRB- Where the advice of the Board is required , no final action in respect of the loss , damage or other discrepancy may be taken before such advice is received .
 It therefore appreciated the efforts made over the previous two years by various States to promote discussion on that issue . In order to mitigate the human suffering caused by the arms covered by Amended Protocol II and the Ottawa Convention , States parties should not only render assistance to demining efforts and support for victims , but should also provide citizens and organizations with an opportunity to promote that   cause   . Recently , private citizens , companies and non-governmental organizations had taken such an opportunity by participating in the âNight of a Thousand Dinnersâ organized by the Canadian Land Mines Foundation , a fund-raising event for the countries worst affected by landmines .
 However , legislative and judiciary practice in Benin is based upon a legal duality : the provisions of the Civil Code and the customary law of Dahomey . The Civil Code -LRB- article 1108 -RRB- provides four essential conditions for the validity of an agreement : the consent of each party , the capacity of each party to contract an agreement , a specified object and a lawful   cause   . Article 1123 of the Civil Code provides that anyone can contract an agreement unless declared incapable by law , either because he/she is a minor or emancipated minor or because he/she is a protected major -LRB- e.g. a ward of the nation -RRB- .

 In particular , in its 2001 Ministerial Declaration , the Council noted the importance of your proposal to create a subregional United Nations coordinating capability in West Africa to assist the United Nations system in developing integrated policies and strategies , ensuring harmonization of activities , and lending support to national and subregional integration . In 1999 , the Council contributed to the discussion of and follow-up to your report on the   causes   of conflict in Africa , and in 1998 the Council noted the need to develop , through a strategic framework , a comprehensive approach to countries in crisis , in which key aspects of durable recovery , peace-building , all human rights , sustained economic growth and sustainable development should be included -LRB- agreed conclusions 1998/1 -RRB- . With regard to the suggestions contained in your report for a more active involvement of the Economic and Social Council when the Security Council sets up regional initiatives for the prevention of armed conflicts , the Council should be in a better position to do so as it develops a more operational coordination capacity , for example , through the planned operation of the ad hoc advisory group on African countries emerging from conflict interacting with the Security Council 's Ad Hoc Working Group on Africa .
 Sub-paragraph 2 -LRB- a -RRB- European Council Directive 91/477/EEC imposes on Italy , along with all other member States of the EU an obligation to permit the acquisition of a certain category of weapon only by persons who have a good   cause   to have such a weapon and are not likely to be a danger to public order or safety . The CTC would be grateful far clarification of what constitutes a âgood causeâ in Italy for these purposes and of the procedure for determining whether a person poses a danger to public order and safety .
 In Italy , Directive 91/477/EEC was incorporated into Italian law on a more restrictive basis than the Community Directive ; for Italian legislation provides that category C and D weapons , namely those for which the Directive only makes provision for reporting in order to be able to acquire or transfer them , now form part of category B , which require a specific license for their manufacture , import , export , collection for reasons of trade or industry , and their sale . Furthermore , as far as the issue of authorisation to bear firearms for personal defence purposes which obviously do not fall under category A -LRB- prohibited firearms -RRB- , provision is made for the applicant to prove a manifest need and just cause , and for the authority to verify that there is both a need and a just   cause   , in a case by case basis . Please explain how Italy deals with the issue of recruitment of members of terrorist groups , both inside and outside Italy , on the basis of Article 270 bis of the Penal Code ?
 It was aware of the need to strengthen its anti-drug institutions , however , and required both technical and financial support from the international community in that area . Poverty and unemployment were both   causes   and consequences of illicit drug trafficking and the link between combating poverty and combating drug trafficking must be recognized . In its efforts to counter transnational organized crime , his Government was conducting a thorough overhaul of its judicial system , under a joint technical assistance programme with UNDP .

 His delegation preferred to see the paragraph deleted in its entirety or , if that was not acceptable to the Commission , at least to have the mandatory provisions of the paragraph removed to allow for a more flexible interpretation by agreement of the parties . The opening phrase âIn any caseâ should also be deleted and there should be a clear statement in the draft Guide to Enactment that paragraph -LRB- 3 -RRB- did not seek to create a new   cause   of action to challenge the conciliation , that any challenge would be made in accordance with existing contract law and that the conduct , not the result , of the proceedings must be fair -LRB- since the result would almost always be subjective in the eyes of the parties -RRB- . The Chairman asked for reactions to the argument put forward by the delegation of the United States .
 Weapons of mass destruction , plastic explosives , and nuclear material shall be seized , confiscated and forfeited to the Marshall Islands ; and the Attorney General shall provide for their destruction for their destruction or other appropriate disposition . For the purpose of forfeiture proceedings under this section , a temporary restraining order and seizure warrant may be entered upon application of the Attorney General without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or complaint has not yet been filed with respect to the property , where there is probable   cause   to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would , in the event of conviction , be subject to forfeiture under this section and exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person in danger . The provisions of this section shall be implemented without prejudice to the rights of third parties acting in good faith .
 The world is witnessing a war of aggression being perpetrated against Iraq . Anyone can see that this war is unjustified and is not being waged in a just   cause   . If its purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , then what about Israel , which has a stockpile of those weapons , including nuclear weapons , which not even some major countries possess ?
 Sri Lanka was currently embarking on a political process of dealing with a group that had engaged in armed conflict with successive democratically elected Governments for over two decades . It fully subscribed to the position , recognized in international legal instruments , that no   cause   could justify terrorist acts ; however , it considered it essential to address the underlying grievances of minority groups at the political level in order to remove the seeds of discontent that led to conflicts within States . Mr. Abdalla -LRB- Sudan -RRB- , speaking on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference , said that the Organization of the Islamic Conference -LRB- OIC -RRB- strongly condemned all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , including State terrorism .
 In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the Sub-Commission to prepare a report containing information on violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from all available sources for the use of the Commission . In paragraph 6 , the Commission invited the Sub-Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission any situation which it had reasonable   cause   to believe revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any country , including policies of racial discrimination , segregation and apartheid , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent territories . In its resolution 2003/59 , the Commission further welcomed the improved working methods of the Sub-Commission at its fifty-fourth as well as its fifty-third sessions. It reiterated and reaffirmed :
 It is important to acknowledge that progress has been made , but so much still remains to be done . Mr. GuÃ©henno spoke of the key challenge of increasing awareness among participants in peacekeeping operations and local communities they come into contact with , about the   causes   of HIV/AIDS and how to prevent its spread . I noted his comments about the difficulty of working with 92 nations and 42 , 000 personnel in the field .
 The HIV/AIDS epidemic is not just a health-care issue. It truly has demographic , economic , social and ethnical dimensions . The AIDS pandemic has become the   cause   of a severe development crisis that is destabilizing entire societies and posing threats to peace and security . My delegation fully recognizes â as reflected in Security Council resolution 1308 -LRB- 2000 -RRB- â that there is a clear link between the AIDS pandemic , peace and security .
 Interlocutory appeals from decisions of Trial Chambers generally arise pursuant to four specific rules : -LRB- i -RRB- rule 65 on requests for provisional release ; -LRB- ii -RRB- rule 72 on decisions on preliminary motions ; -LRB- iii -RRB- rule 73 on decisions on other motions ; and -LRB- iv -RRB- rule 108 bis on state requests for review . Sub-rule 65 -LRB- D -RRB- provides that any Trial Chamber decision under rule 65 on provisional release shall be subject to appeal in cases where leave is granted by a bench of three judges of the Appeals Chamber , upon good   cause   being shown . Trial Chamber decisions under rule 72 involving a challenge to jurisdiction under sub-rule 72 -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- may be appealed to the full Appeals Chamber , provided that a bench of three judges of the Appeals Chamber , pursuant to rule 72 -LRB- E -RRB- , decides that the appeal is from a decision on a motion challenging jurisdiction as defined by rule 72 -LRB- D -RRB- .
 No current legislation exists regarding matrimonial property and the courts rely on the common law and precedent to determine the rights of each party . The dissolution of marriage according to the Divorce and Matrimonial   Causes   Ordinance 1961 can be made on the following grounds and a petition for dissolution can be made by either spouse : The dissolution of marriage is based on the principle of proving the âfaultâ of the other party viz. a vis one party is required to prove the other 's adultery , cruelty or desertion .
 Recommendations Petition a comprehensive review of the Divorce and Matrimonial   Causes   Ordinance 1961 with the objective to reviewing the âfault-basedâ system for dissolution of marriage and to remove discriminatory references with respect performance of women 's domestic duties. Petition a review of the Marriage Ordinance 1961 with the objective of providing equal treatment of both sexes with respect minimum age of marriage with and without parent/guardian consent . Publish pamphlets in English and Samoan to educate all women on their legal rights .
 The Matrimonial Proceedings Act 2001 has also been passed . This Act re-enacts Part II of the Judicature -LRB- Matrimonial   Causes   -RRB- Act 1976 and Part III of the Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1986 ; makes new provision for the sharing of pensions on the dissolution or annulment of marriage , and enables reciprocal provision to be made for the enforcement of certain financial orders . A copy of this Act is attached at Annex VII .
 We wish to highlight the coordination work being accomplished by UNAMA and the concerted work of all the competent bodies and agencies of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , humanitarian assistance organizations and civil society . In Afghanistan , as in other contemporary conflicts , the international community must strengthen international cooperation in order to tackle the   causes   of these conflicts and to act in a timely way to reconstruct national institutions and to bring about economic rehabilitation . Nonetheless , in spite of the progress made by the Interim Authority since the Bonn Agreements , Mexico is concerned that problems remain that are real threats to security and to the democratic process that is beginning to be established .
 It may not be possible to ensure the elimination of all acts of terrorism through those policy measures . But at least through the use of such measures we will have deprived many potential terrorists of   causes   or justifications for resorting to terrorism . As noted at the open meeting of the Security Council on 23 July , the emotional impact of the events of 11 September 2001 is now decreasing .
 Some legal systems allow for organizations or groups representing collectivities to act in a collective capacity to present claims and even to receive remedies on behalf of those who constitute part of the group or collectivity , irrespective of whether they are identified . Most legal systems , however , do not recognize a   cause   of action , or a right to representative claims , unless an agency relationship exists . It could be difficult to reconcile these two approaches .
 The Bill makes terrorism an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes , and provides that when murder occurs in the course of a âterrorist actâ -LRB- as defined in section 5 of the Terrorism Suppression Act -RRB- , there will be a presumption in favour of 17 years ' minimum non-parole . The Bill also gives the New Zealand Customs Service the power to detain property intercepted crossing the border , where there is good   cause   to suspect that the property is owned or controlled by a designated terrorist entity , or an entity that is eligible for designation under the Terrorism Suppression Act . In the case of already-designated entities , Customs will be able to detain all property intercepted .
 Section 126 of the 1987 Act , as now amended , provides that people who arrive at other than designated New Zealand Customs ports of entry must now report âforthwithâ to an immigration officer -LRB- they had previously been given 72 hours in which to report -RRB- . Where there is good   cause   to suspect that a person will not or has not reported âforthwithâ , a police officer may now arrest that person and bring them to an immigration officer . The Immigration Act has also been amended so that the 72-hour period during which a person arriving in New Zealand may be refused entry , detained or turned around now begins when the person first reports to an immigration officer and not from the time of their arrival .
 Approximately two-thirds of this gap -LRB- or 10 % -RRB- can be explained by factors such as age , labour market experience or education . The largest single   cause   of the wage differential was time spent by women out of the workforce caring and rearing children . The unexplained portion of the gap stood at around 5 % .
 Thailand had also been a co-sponsor of resolutions on human rights defenders adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights ; and supported the review of special procedures - including the formulation of better guidelines for their operation and reporting - as a part of the United Nations reform process . On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 2003 , Thailand reaffirmed its commitment to the cause of democracy , the rule of law and human rights and its determination to cooperate constructively with the international community on furthering that noble   cause   . Mr. Gansukh -LRB- Mongolia -RRB- said that it was important to intensify human-rights protection efforts , strengthen the rule of law and promote democracy at the national and international levels , because , despite the international community 's continued endeavour to promote human rights , there was a number of cases in which no notable progress had been made .
 This sub-item was included as an additional item in the agenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly , in 1998 , at the request of Namibia -LRB- A/53/231 -RRB- . In April 1998 , at the request of the Security Council , the Secretary-General had submitted a report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- . The General Assembly considered the item at its fifty-third to fifty-fifth sessions -LRB- resolutions 53/92 , 54/234 and 55/217 -RRB- .
 As the Secretary-General states in paragraph 61 of his report on the work of the Organization , terrorism âcontinues to pose a major threat to international peace and securityâ , and we must continue to fight it at all times . The international community also needs to understand the   causes   of terrorism in order to be able to react in an efficient way and improve situations that lead to such a phenomenon . Terrorism is not the weapon of a particular region , culture , religion or socio-economic group. It is a strategy that originates in all civilizations and human societies .
 the extent that they are governed by a specified national law applicable to motor carriers -RRB- . -LRB- d -RRB- The Draft Instrument pre-empts all other   causes   of action -LRB- whether founded in contract , in tort , or otherwise -RRB- against -LRB- i -RRB- the carrier , and -LRB- ii -RRB- all performing parties that are subject to the Draft Instrument -LRB- i.e. , all performing parties with respect to which the relevant contracting State has not opted out of coverage -RRB- . To the extent that a performing party is not subject to the Draft Instrument , its potential liability is governed by whatever law would have applied in the absence of the Draft Instrument .
 The basic principle of Option 3 is that suits under the Draft Instrument will be the exclusive remedy available to a cargo interest against the carrier for cargo damage during door-to-door transport . In addition , no suit could be brought against a performing party for such damage unless at the time of the ratification a State indicates that it is preserving whatever   causes   of action would otherwise apply . -LRB- A State could opt out for certain performing parties , as described under Option 1 , see above , paragraphs 166 to 176 .
 The advantage of the approach in Option 3 is that it would encourage a maximally uniform system , while allowing flexibility for countries with other law applicable to the land portions of the journey . However , the disadvantage of Option 3 is that a country that as a matter of policy does not favour elimination of such   causes   of action might not want a presumption in favour of this built into the Convention . Official Records of the General Assembly , Fifty-sixth Session , Supplement No. 17 -LRB- A/56/17 -RRB- , para .
 Maritime performing parties would thus include , for example , ocean carriers , feeder carriers , stevedores working in the port area , and marine terminal operators . With regard to other performing parties , the Instrument should not create new   causes   of action or preempt existing causes of action . For example , the liability of an inland carrier -LRB- e.g. , a trucker or a railroad -RRB- should be based on existing law .

 In some countries , this may be a regional unimodal convention such as CMR. In others , it may be a mandatory or nonmandatory domestic law governing inland carriage , or the generally applicable tort law . In some countries , cargo interests may not have a   cause   of action against inland performing parties . Preserving the status quo in this regard would , of course , preserve whatever rights an inland performing party may have under applicable national law to rely on a Himalaya clause to claim the benefit of the contracting carrier 's rights under the Instrument .
 The listed forums may not be suitable for actions against a performing party . To the extent that a cargo claimant has a   cause   of action under the Instrument against a performing party , the plaintiff should be permitted to bring suit in any forum having jurisdiction over the defendant . Exceptions to general rule in OLSA cases
 Recommendation : To implement this aspect of the proposal , the bracketed language in article 6.4.1 and the bracketed language referring to delay in article 6.8 should be deleted. Article 6.4.2 should be revised as follows : If delay in delivery   causes   loss not resulting from physical loss of or damage to the goods carried , the carrier may be held liable for such loss only if the carrier has expressly agreed to be liable for such loss resulting from delay . Mixed contracts and shipper 's agent arrangements
 Mr. Mwandembwa -LRB- United Republic of Tanzania -RRB- said that the International Criminal Court was at last a reality , although the road to its formation had not been smooth . His Government had ratified the Rome Statute in August 2002 and was ready and willing to cooperate to advance the   cause   of the Court . The choice of competent and experienced individuals as judges and Prosecutor had allayed fears that the Court could not handle its heavy responsibilities .
 His delegation looked forward to cooperating in that task . Impressive though the rate of ratification had been , there was no   cause   for complacency . The importance of universalization of the jurisdiction of the Court was well understood .
 -LRB- 3 -RRB- Prevailing commercial and banking customs and practices in the market in which they operate ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- Unusually high amounts , complexity and atypical patterns of transactions without apparent economic or lawful   cause   ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- Multiple or separate amounts that , added together , equal or exceed the equivalent of US $ 10 , 000 ;
 Counsel points out , however , that forensic evidence concluded that Mr. Kourilenkov had died of multiple wounds to the neck and to the body , the left cheek and the larynx , combined with massive haemorrhage and acute traumatic shock . The courts had concluded that Mr. Bondarenko had stabbed Mr. Kourilenkov twice , which in counsel 's opinion did not and could not have been the   cause   of death . 5.2 Counsel recalls that Mr. Voskoboynikov had admitted that he had acted alone in killing Mrs. Martinenko .
 I wish to commend the organizers of this workshop for the appropriateness of the topic , considering the conflict situations in the West African subregion and the very relevant objectives of this workshop . Although the issue of the proliferation of and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is a global problem , we in West Africa have   cause   to be more concerned about it because of the havoc that the use of these weapons has caused to lives and property in the subregion . It is sad to observe that , of the 500 million light weapons believed to be in circulation worldwide , as many as 30 million are projected to be in use in Africa , with as many as 8 million in West Africa alone .
 The number of kidnappings recorded by the Home Office had increased from 545 in 1990 to 2 , 404 in 2001 . UNOMIG reported that in Georgia the   causes   of kidnapping were a complex mix of political and criminal factors . In Colombia , where the problem had assumed serious proportions , increases were attributed to the greater tendency of criminal and guerrilla groups to resort to kidnapping .
 Recalling the Brazzaville Declaration on Cooperation for Peace and Security in Central Africa , the Bata Declaration for the Promotion of Lasting Democracy , Peace and Development in Central Africa , and the YaoundÃ© Declaration on Peace , Security and Stability in Central Africa , Bearing in mind resolutions 1196 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and 1197 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , adopted by the Security Council on 16 and 18 September 1998 respectively , following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , Emphasizing the need to strengthen the capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa ,
 That process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis , neither hurried nor delayed by the wishes of other parties . And the United Nations can contribute greatly to the   cause   of Iraqi self-government . America is working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution , which will expand the United Nation 's role in Iraq .
 During the long years of war , part of Congolese territory was under the control of forces of aggression that supported plundering , exploitation and uncontrolled trade in these natural resources . There is   cause   for concern about the consequences and damage stemming from those acts , such as abusive use of those resources for terrorist purposes . My delegation therefore urges the international community to support the current peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to help the established authorities secure our national borders , thus ending the illegal exploitation of the wealth of our country .
 In conflict prevention as well as in post-conflict reconstruction , employment creation plays an important role in mitigating social tension , rehabilitating former combatants and helping to rebuild war-torn areas . Unemployment , underemployment and job insecurity are the   causes   as well as the outcomes of the social vulnerability suffered by various groups . Lack of employment and job security can result in income insecurity and poverty , which in turn contribute to social vulnerability through social discrimination , greater exposure to risks and weak coping capacity .
 Progress towards peace elsewhere - in Angola and Sri Lanka - also heralded new opportunities for return movements . More recently , the evolving situation in Burundi has given   cause   for optimism that there too , voluntary repatriation may soon be under way . Hopes are now pinned on the stabilization of these peace processes to allow for sustainable reintegration of returnees .
 Welcoming the designation of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat as a centre for the coordination of all activities of United Nations bodies concerned with small arms , Congratulating the Secretary-General for his report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , and bearing in mind the statement on small arms made by the President of the Security Council on 24 September 1999 , Welcoming the recommendations resulting from the meetings of the States of the subregion held at Banjul , Algiers , Bamako , Yamoussoukro and Niamey to establish close regional cooperation with a view to strengthening security ,
 The Secretary-General is deeply disturbed at this mounting death toll , and he is gravely concerned for the future of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples , as well as for the wider Middle East region , if death and destruction are not replaced by peace and reconciliation . Developments in the past month give little   cause   for optimism and no room at all for complacency . On 25 January , after a number of Qassam rockets were fired by Palestinians on Israeli communities inside and outside the Gaza Strip , the Israel Defence Forces -LRB- IDF -RRB- entered Gaza City in their biggest operation in the Gaza Strip since September 2000 .
 One does not trump the other . The international community 's current and justifiable concern about proliferation matters must not divert our attention from the bigger picture of a world where the norms against proliferation and for nuclear disarmament make common   cause   . In this regard , there has never before been a more urgent need for the five nuclear-weapon States to deliver on their commitments under the NPT regime .
 The highest level of sanctions would be applied , which would prohibit all commercial and financial transactions between any Nauru-registered financial institution and the United States . In May 2003 Nauru was accordingly informed and was given 30 days to show   cause   as to why the sanction should not be applied . Nauru submitted its comments , passed new laws in March of this year repealing the registration of offshore banks , and included a sunset clause terminating the licenses that would come into effect 30 to 180 days â as the case may be â from 27 March 2003 , when the law came into force .
 We have consistently denounced all acts of terrorism and violence . We intensely believe that there can be no rightful   cause   to justify terrorism . Yet , dealing with terrorism should not lead to further violence .
 President Bush had expressed his personal commitment to the road map and to its immediate publication once the new Palestinian Government was in office , but that commitment had been accompanied by worrisome additions which might open the door to unlimited changes to the document , making it useless in practice . The Palestinian side saw little   cause   for optimism , but was waiting patiently for practical steps to be taken to translate the road map into action . Its basic position had not changed : there could be no solid foundation for the Middle East peace process without the necessary legal authority , which could come only from the United Nations Security Council .
 The tragic events in Bali and Moscow in October 2002 had heightened the general feeling of insecurity provoked by the attacks of 11 September 2001 . No   cause   could justify terrorism , a phenomenon that must be universally and unequivocally condemned . Successfully countering terrorism , however , required more than rigorous law enforcement ; it also required a longer-term and more holistic approach , as well as a determination to ensure that all people enjoyed all their rights .
 The widow loses the possibility of supporting herself by means of the inheritance if there is acknowledged cohabitation . Moreover , article 264 , in providing that one of the   causes   of the dissolution of the marriage is decease , contradicts article 692 of the Code , which provides that a wife shall be denied her right of usufruct if she remarries outside the family without good reason or if there is no proven right of inheritance by the widow . Inheritance rules are thus inconsistent , in making a certain number of concessions to tradition and custom .
 The fourth suggestion was that all of the provisions of the draft instrument that make reference to performing parties should be reviewed so that in those provisions relating to the liability of the carrier for acts or negligence of performing parties -LRB- e.g. draft articles 14 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- reference should continue to be made to performing parties generally , whether maritime or not , while in those provisions that relate to the obligations and the liability of performing parties , reference should only be made to maritime performing parties . Amongst others , it was suggested that draft articles 15 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 15 -LRB- 4 -RRB- should be revised to create a direct   cause   of action against maritime performing parties only . Similarly , it was suggested that the âHimalayaâ protection of article 15 -LRB- 5 -RRB- should be extended to maritime performing parties only .
 This is not a question of ability it is a question of will . When Security Council members have had the audacity to suggest that it is actually appropriate for any resolution addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to refer to Palestinian obligations to fight terrorism , that alone is sufficient   cause   to convene yet another General Assembly emergency special session to manufacture yet another piece of paper that does not move the peace process forward one iota . That that piece of paper imagines an alternate reality without terrorism of the most vicious and brutal kind , a reality of Palestinian entitlement but no Palestinian obligation , a reality where Israel alone is cast as villain and the Palestinian side alone as victim , is apparently of little concern to the Palestinian side .
 The continuing fragility of democratic political processes in the subregion was demonstrated most recently by the coup d'Ã©tat in the Central African Republic in March 2003 and the attempted coup in Sao Tome and Principe in July 2003 . In his report of 13 April 1998 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/52/871-S/1998/318 -RRB- , the Secretary-General observed that the causes of conflict in Africa vary , reflecting the diversity and complexity of the continent . They include historical legacies , internal and external factors and economic motives .
 Apart from the specific provisions giving jurisdiction to the courts of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in our Protection of Aircraft Act and Maritime Security Act -LRB- mentioned in CTC 's Questionnaire -RRB- , there are specific provisions on `jurisdiction ' in our other anti-terrorist laws like the Act against the Taking of Hostages , 2002 and the United Nations -LRB- Anti-Terrorism Measures -RRB- Act , 2002. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act against the Taking of Hostage , 2002 state as follow : - â3. -LRB- 1 -RRB- Every person who confines , imprisons , forcibly seizes or detains another person , and who threatens the death of , injury to , or the continued detention of that person in order to compel a third party to commit any act or omission or   cause   to be committed any act or omission as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of that person commits an act of hostage taking . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Every person
 Recent research demonstrated that children living in institutions were often subject to ill-treatment and abuse and that in many cases the conditions in which they lived , especially in larger institutions , were appalling . Her country believed there was a good   cause   for the United Nations , on the basis of the Convention , to identify the basic rights of children living in institutions and recommend monitoring procedures . The number of unaccompanied children had also increased in some parts of the world .
 The intifada was a result of increased feelings of frustration and despair , lack of security and an absence of hope for any possibility of reaching a peaceful solution with an Israeli Government that adopts a policy of war , aggression and expansion and that rejects , aborts and avoids every peace initiative , using excessive and disproportionate force against Palestinian civilians . The targeting of Palestinian civilians is a war crime that can not be justified by any   cause   , as stated by Under-Secretary-General Kieran Prendergast in his briefing to the Security Council on 21 October 2003 . The military oppression by the occupation forces has even affected international relief organizations , including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East -LRB- UNRWA -RRB- and the Red Cross and its staff and institutions .
 The Prime Minister must be invested with the necessary authority to combat terror and violence and to restore public order . No political   cause   can justify those attacks that , in addition to their illegal and intolerable character , destroy the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people . Switzerland has consistently condemned such attacks because they constitute a grave violation of international law and reduce Israeli support for the peace process .
 But the message we have received in return â from the barrage of terrorist attacks against innocent civilians ; from the virulent incitement and anti-Semitism that plague much of our region ; from the funding , support and glorification of murder as martyrdom ; and from the endless resort to blatantly one-sided resolutions and selective treatment of Israel at the United Nations â is crystal clear . If one wants to really understand the   causes   of the Arab-Israeli conflict , one need look no further than the continuing refusal of too many countries in the region to recognize the legitimate rights of the Jewish people to self-determination in their ancient homeland , side by side with their Arab neighbours . It is this rejection that feeds the aggression demonstrated against Israel .

 The Bali victims called at least 25 different countries home . No   cause   justifies the murder of innocent people . We totally reject terrorists and terrorism .
 However , the Committee 's work is far from over , for combating terrorism is a long-term endeavour which requires the strengthening of national legislations and the ratification by States of the various international instruments . My delegation would restate its strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , whatever the   cause   the perpetrators claim to be defending . Political disputes and differences should not overshadow our commitment to combat this evil , which affects the international community as a whole .
 Health and poverty Ill health   causes   poverty by destroying livelihoods , reducing worker productivity , lowering educational achievement and limiting opportunities . Because poverty may lead to diminished access to medical care , increased exposure to environmental risks , the worst forms of child labour and malnutrition , ill health is also often a consequence of poverty .
 First , under the Italian proposal , the contracting carrier 's liability to the shipper would be on a fully uniform basis -LRB- using the liability limits established by the instrument -RRB- , rather than under subparagraph 4.2.1 's limited network system . Second , under the Italian proposal , the instrument would create a   cause   of action by the cargo owner against the performing party on the terms of the contract between the performing party and the carrier . Thus , under the Italian proposal , the cargo interests would in effect step into the shoes of the contracting carrier vis-Ã -vis the performing party .
 The example was given of goods being shipped from Tokyo to Rotterdam via Singapore , and whether the stevedore handling the goods in Singapore was subject to the draft instrument if either Japan or the Netherlands had ratified it but Singapore had not . It was said that a direct   cause   of action against a performing party in a non-contracting State should not be maintained in the draft instrument . Interest was shown in the proposal by the United States that the draft instrument should provide different treatment for maritime performing parties and for inland performing parties , but the view was expressed that firm positions on the proposal could not be expressed until it was formally presented at a later date .
 It was stated that , under that proposal , maritime performing parties would be treated pursuant to paragraph 6.3 , and thus they would be subject to action under the terms of the draft instrument , receiving all of the benefits of the carrier 's defences and limitations . Subparagraphs 6.3.1 and 6.3.3 would have to be modified with respect to inland performing parties , however , so that the draft instrument would not create any additional   cause   of action against them , nor create any additional Himalaya protection for them , outside of the existing applicable law . The view was expressed that separate treatment of maritime and inland performing parties would be of particular importance if mandatory national law was not included in subparagraph 4.2.1 .
 Efforts need to move beyond addressing the symptoms and effects of violence to tackling the root causes . A focus on the structural   causes   of gender-based violence should involve a focus on men and boys and what drives them to violence . There is a particular need to target the needs of young boys for positive male role models in societies with âcultures of violenceâ , crises of identity for men in rapidly changing societies and high prevalence of female-headed households .
 Under Governing Council decision 9 , losses that are due solely to the trade embargo and related measures -LRB- the âtrade embargoâ -RRB- are not compensable . However , decision 9 provides that claims may be compensated to the extent that Iraq 's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait constituted a   cause   of direct loss , damage or injury that is parallel to , but separate and distinct from , the trade embargo . The Panel applies these rules concerning the trade embargo to the present claims .
 Progress towards peace elsewhere â in Angola and Sri Lanka â also heralded new opportunities for return movements . More recently , the evolving situation in Burundi has given   cause   for optimism that there too , voluntary repatriation may soon be under way . Hopes are now pinned on the stabilization of these peace processes to allow for sustainable reintegration of returnees .

 3.4 It is stated that Bahrain has ratified the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism by its Law No. Please outline this law . Bahrain has a firm and clear position of principle in condemning all forms and manifestations of terrorism , whatever their   cause   . It is determined to cooperate closely to prevent and suppress terrorism , and to prevent any form of financing of terrorism , in accordance with its commitments under related international resolutions , particularly Security Council resolution 1373 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- .
 Today 's debate is crucial to the future of Africa . Both the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- and the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General 's report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa remain at the top of our agenda , both in Africa and at the international level . I am pleased that at long last we have all agreed on the need to address these issues together , as both development and conflict issues are two faces of the same coin , insofar as Africa is concerned .
 The shared history , friendship and common values that bind us together demand nothing less . Mr. Kumalo -LRB- South Africa -RRB- : I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the two comprehensive reports that are under consideration today â one on the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- -LRB- A/58/254 -RRB- and another on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- A/58/352 -RRB- . We believe that both these reports are extremely important and while they might address similar challenges , they are nevertheless distinct .
 South Africa is looking forward to the adoption by the General Assembly during its current session of the report of the forty-first session of the Commission for Social Development . As far as the future of the report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa is concerned , South Africa will wish to see the continuation of the report . While it may be true that many of the issues dealt with in that report can be found elsewhere , it is of great importance to have the information collected in one report that focuses on all the issues as they particularly relate to Africa .
 Africa does not need more advice or recipes to solve its conflicts ; it needs financial resources . Despite what is said in debates and affirmed in numerous resolutions , emphasis continues to be on reacting to conflicts in Africa instead of on preventing them and eliminating their   causes   . Various initiatives and proposals related to Africa continue to proliferate at the United Nations , but there is still a lack of political will and altruism on the part of former colonial Powers , as well as a comprehensive approach to solve problems related to peace , security and development on the continent .
 I reiterate the Secretary-General 's strong and consistent condemnation of such acts of terrorism . The deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime , and can not be justified by any   cause   . We call on the Palestinian Authority to bring to justice those who plan and carry out such attacks and to live up to its obligations under the road map as regards security .

 Mr. Jose -LRB- India -RRB- : We would like to thank the Secretary-General for his first consolidated report on progress in the implementation of and international support for the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -LRB- NEPAD -RRB- . We would also like thank him for the report on the implementation of his recommendations on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . We have considered both reports with interest .
 Ownership of NEPAD must relate to the needs of the ordinary people of Africa and not just to Governments . We note that the review of implementation of the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General 's report regarding the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace in Africa indicates that there has been progress , although it has been slow and uneven . We should bear in mind that there is a clearly established link between poverty on the one hand and political instability on the other .
 Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , other relevant components of the United Nations system , other humanitarian organizations and regional organizations to continue to cooperate within their respective mandates and in accordance with international law in the creation of an environment for a viable and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons in post-conflict societies ; Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in the exercise of his mandate and in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons , to pay particular attention to human rights situations which   cause   , threaten to cause or affect mass exoduses of populations and to contribute to efforts to address such situations effectively through promotion and protection measures , emergency preparedness and response mechanisms , early warning and information-sharing , technical advice and expertise and cooperation in countries of origin and host countries ; Welcomes with appreciation the ongoing contributions of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Representative of the Secretary-General to the deliberations of the Commission and to other international human rights bodies and mechanisms , invites them to exchange relevant information on mass exoduses and displacements with all United Nations bodies , including the human rights treaty bodies , acting within their mandates , and invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to address the Commission at each of its future sessions ;
 Indeed , conflicts have often spilled across borders , as we have seen in the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The   causes   of conflicts are complex in the Great Lakes region and so are their solutions . While it is necessary to address a conflict at national and subnational levels , it is not possible to also sustain peace until it is achieved and sustained at the national level .

 The Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has on a number of occasions categorically condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including State terrorism , of which Libya has been the most prominent victim , and has contributed actively to international efforts to combat and eradicate it . Libya was the first State to call for a special session of the General Assembly or an international conference within the framework of that organization to investigate the phenomenon of terrorism and its   causes   , to give it a precise definition and to take appropriate measures to combat and eradicate it . The fact that Libya has implemented all the Security Council resolutions concerning international terrorism , and notably resolution 1373 -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , having complied with the provisions thereof and submitted initial and supplementary reports to the Committee established pursuant to that resolution , constitutes further evidence of the extent of Libya 's sustained cooperation in putting an end to this phenomenon , which is morally repugnant and inhumane and threatens the security of States and the lives and stability of peoples .
 Israel has no desire unduly to burden the Palestinian population , but , rather , to ensure the security of Israeli citizens facing daily threats to their very lives . The Secretary-General 's report -LRB- A/58/88 -RRB- recognizes the terrorist attacks by Palestinians against Israelis as a   cause   of the present crisis . The challenge Israel faces is to do its utmost to protect its citizens , while doing as much as it can to minimize the impact of tightened security on the Palestinian population , among whom terrorists hide and operate , in violation of international humanitarian law .
 -LRB- spoke in English -RRB- Despite serious challenges , the Afghan Government has made some progress in addressing the   causes   of insecurity . First among those steps , reform of the senior level of the Ministry of Defence has been completed .
 In our relentless struggle against terrorism , it is important to give appropriate responses when it comes to the sovereignty of peoples , respect for human rights , social justice and combating poverty . We must also seriously analyse the   causes   that serve as the breeding ground or pretext for terrorism . This is also part of conflict prevention and , to some extent , the prevention of terrorism .
 Legislation and procedures have not yet been developed to prevent the abuse of refugee status by terrorists . In practice , however , Vanuatu has not yet had   cause   to accept any refugees . Vanuatu 's extradition law does not make specific provision to prevent claims of political motivation being recognised as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists .
 The Labour Law also includes the prohibition of unequal treatment - unequal treatment on the grounds of gender is prohibited upon establishing employment relations as well as during the existence of employment relations , in particular in the vent of promoting and employee , determining the working conditions , remuneration for work or vocational training , as well as in the event of terminating an employment contract . It also defines indirect discrimination as a situation when evidently neutral terms , criteria or practice   cause   unfavourable consequences for a considerably larger part of persons belonging to one gender , except the case when such terms , criteria or practice are suitable and necessary and may be justified by objective circumstances that are not related to the gender . According to norms of this Law , differences in treatment related to the gender of the employee are allowed only if belonging to a specific gender is an objective and justified prerequisite for the performance of the respective assignment or the respective occupation .
 Nevertheless , the situations envisaged under model provisions 41 and 44 were clearly distinct ; in the first case , the situation was judged to be temporary , whereas in the second it was judged to be permanent enough to justify termination of the contract . Mr. Rwangampuhwe -LRB- Rwanda -RRB- said that the wording of subparagraph -LRB- a -RRB- allowed for a subjective evaluation of the situation , thus providing scope for the contracting authority to terminate the contract without due   cause   . The provision should be more rigorously drafted in order to eliminate that element of flexibility .
 -LRB- 3 -RRB- Collection of the budgetary funds of local governments , which are located at a credit institution , may be exercised by uncontested procedures at the request of the State Treasury in cases provided for by other laws.â The Law âOn Prevention of the Laundering of the Proceeds from Crimeâ obliges every credit institution or financial institution to refrain from conducting a transaction if there is a   cause   to suspect that this particular transaction is associated with the laundering or attempted laundering of proceeds of crime . Funds of persons who commit , attempt to commit , participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts are considered to be proceeds of crime according to Latvian law .
 The same must therefore be true , a fortiori , of the Guide to Practice . The explanatory phrase that introduces article 22 , paragraph 1 , may seem superfluous , but most members of the Commission take the view that this is not sufficient   cause   for modifying the wording chosen in 1969 and retained in 1986 . -LRB- 16 -RRB- This phrase , with its reference to treaty provisions , seems to suggest that model clauses should be included in the Guide to Practice .
 The terrorist attack on the United Nations compound in Iraq is yet another manifestation of that which seeks to destroy the values of humanity , and presents a serious challenge to those striving for sustainable peace through the promotion and preservation of human rights in the midst of conflict and strife . Those striving for the rights of minorities or women , advancing the cause of religious tolerance and accommodation of ethnic or racial diversity , or resisting trends of ultranationalism have been some of the first victims of forms of extremism that have become the major   cause   of terrorism . They have also been in the front line to combat these trends in order to preserve the norms of peace and democracy , as conditions that are fundamental for the promotion , protection and enjoyment of human rights .
 Inevitably , past reports of the Special Representative have focused on analysis of the information available . However , she considers that there is   cause   also to draw attention to some noticeable absences of information . There are a number of States from where there is a significant silence on the part of human rights defenders , in spite of concerns with regard to human rights within those States .
 In Kosovo , therefore , there is a great deal of work ahead . At the same time , with the successful elections , including at the municipal level ; with a growing , well-trained professional police force ; and with improved freedom of movement and progress elsewhere , there is   cause   for appreciation for the contribution that Special Representative Steiner and UNMIK are making in Kosovo . As I said at the outset of my intervention , the United States thanks Special Representative Steiner and UNMIK for their good work and reiterates our strong support for UNMIK in its mission .
 If the resident agent provides the requested information , such action shall not be regarded as a violation of the confidential relationship between lawyer and client or as a breach of professional ethics , because the matter concerns the higher interest of the Republic of Panama . Lawyers who refuse to provide the requested information without just   cause   shall be held in contempt . Other ways of preventing terrorist-related businesses from operating are described in the information criteria issued by the Superintendency of Banks under article 4 of Agreement No. 9-2000 , under which banks must :

 The fifth aspect is the need to coordinate peacemaking initiatives . The Secretary-General , in a 1998 report on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa -LRB- S/1998/318 -RRB- , made a universally applicable statement when he pointed out that peacemaking efforts need to be well coordinated and well prepared . We must avoid situations in which international actors undertake rival or competing efforts , which would do nothing except make finding a solution even more difficult .
 Eradicating extreme poverty Extreme poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon with varied   causes   , including insufficient economic growth and investment , persistent societal inequalities , inadequate social safety nets , a lack of investment in education and health and a shortage of development finance , as well as prevailing international financial and trade relations that leave lower-income countries at a disadvantage . To enhance the process of development , the following elements are critical : new and increased financing for development ; cooperation from the private sector ; a successful development round of trade negotiations ; the alleviation of urban and rural poverty ; secure access to food , good health and education ; improved governance ; opportunities for women living in poverty ; and use of new technologies such as information and communications technologies for poverty eradication purposes .
 Pakistan had successfully cleared all minefields after the three wars in that part of the continent and no humanitarian situation had been caused by the use of landmines . It was committed to ensuring that the mines in its military inventory would never be the   cause   of civilian casualties in Pakistan or elsewhere . Pakistan had also developed significant expertise in mine clearance and was involved in a number of United Nations-sponsored demining operations around the world .
 I wish to bring to your attention recent developments in the work of the Economic and Social Council on African post-conflict countries . As you know , the Council , in its resolution 2002/1 of 15 July 2003 decided on the principle of creating ad hoc advisory group -LRB- s -RRB- on those countries following General Assembly resolution 55/217 of 21 December 2000 on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . In paragraph 7 of resolution 55/217 , the Assembly requested the Council to âconsider the creation of an ad hoc advisory group on countries emerging from conflict with a view to assessing their humanitarian and economic needs and elaborating a long-term programme of support for implementation that begins with the integration of relief into developmentâ .
 It is immoral to abuse the noble lexicon of freedom to justify the mass murder of innocents and to excuse these abhorrent acts for the advancement of a political agenda . Repeated resolutions and declarations of the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General uphold the principle that any deliberate targeting of civilians for political ends is wrong , unjustifiable and immoral , regardless of   cause   or circumstance . As the world was horrifically reminded on 11 September , if the fires of terrorism rage anywhere , they pose a threat to peace and security everywhere .
 Under Governing Council decision 9 , losses that are due solely to the trade embargo and related measures -LRB- the âtrade embargoâ -RRB- are not compensable . Governing Council decision 9 further provides that compensation is not to be awarded for trade embargo losses except to âthe extent that Iraq 's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait constituted a   cause   of direct loss which is separate and distinct from the trade embargo and related measuresâ . With regard to the valuation principles applicable to contract losses , the Panel recalls the findings of the âE2Aâ Panel that :
 In addition , we thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Ambassador Olara Otunnu , and Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children 's Fund , for their important statements . The   causes   and manifestations of the world 's armed conflicts are myriad , but , whatever those causes and manifestations may be , as long as there are armed conflicts , children â as the most vulnerable group â will be affected by them to varying degrees . Therefore , the international community must work hard to find an effective solution to the problem .
 Prevention should not focus on one drug only , but address substance abuse in general , including the abuse of tobacco , alcohol and inhalants . Indeed , it makes sense to see prevention within the wider concept of health promotion , addressing all practices that   cause   damage to physical and mental well-being . For example , the personal and social skills needed to avoid substance abuse are similar to those needed to avoid other kinds of risky behaviour such as unsafe sex .
 Many of the factors that are particularly detrimental to international logistics services are also those that are found in many developing countries , particularly in least developed countries and small island developing States . These economies in particular are often confronted with a situation where their geographical situation , small trade volumes , and trade imbalances are the   cause   of a difficult starting position for quality and inexpensive international logistics services . Thanks to new information and communication technologies , improvements in infrastructure and the growing rate of containerization , today the same price per tonne of cargo can buy a quicker and more reliable transport service than a decade ago on most trade routes .
 The Industrial Development Board should request the Director-General to ensure that proposals being drawn up for a formal instrument to govern the Office of Comptroller General should include , but not be limited to , the following : -LRB- a -RRB- The Comptroller General should be appointed by the Director-General after appropriate consultations with the Industrial Development Board ; the incumbent may be subject to dismissal by the Director-General only for   cause   , following similar consultations with the Board . -LRB- b -RRB- Reports of the Comptroller General should be sent to the Director-General with a copy to the External Auditor .
 The European Union firmly believes that the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa constitutes one of the major challenges of the international community at the dawn of the twenty-first century . In this regard , we recognize the importance of the report of the Secretary-General on the   causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa . The management of the intra-State and inter-State conflicts that still plague significant parts of the African continent and assistance to African countries emerging from such conflict situations , should , in our view , be among the highest priorities of the United Nations system .
 Its work would be influential in shaping a discrimination-free world . Turning to the relationship between the Committee and the United Nations Secretariat , she said that it relied on mutual respect and common dedication to the   cause   of eliminating discrimination against women . She thanked Ms. King , Assistant Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women , for her tireless efforts to ensure the effectiveness of both the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee and hoped to further the cooperative relationship with the Secretariat , in particular the Division for the Advancement of Women , which now constituted a valuable source of expertise and experience .
 The question here is , when is a permanent member considered to be a party to a given dispute ? Would the use of the veto a specified number of times be sufficient   cause   for the application of Article 27 ? We believe so , because there is no other way to explain the great number of vetoes by the same member on the same issue .
 It went without saying that the continuation of the aforementioned project would require the allocation of additional resources . However , her delegation believed that the allocation of resources for such a worthy   cause   , which would bring the United Nations closer to the people of the world , would prove to be a good investment . Mr. Al-Hajeri -LRB- Kuwait -RRB- expressed appreciation for the important work of the Department of Public Information in making people aware of the activities of the United Nations .
 Those serving in categories H , A and B duty stations are âexpectedâ to apply for vacancies in hardship duty stations -LRB- guidelines issued on 21 December 1999 -RRB- . As staff members expect to be provided with employment while reserving the right to exclude themselves from jobs for which they are qualified and needed , the policy is in itself a   cause   of the âstaff-in-between-assignmentâ phenomenon analysed below . Exceptions to the policy take different forms -LRB- staff with personal constraints , medical constraints , or staff on âspecialistâ posts , whose number has increased from 101 in 1998 to 120 in 2002 -RRB- , not all of them being documented .
 If the limit is exceeded , liability is allocated to the lessee or permittee of the area in which the activity is located , again up to a limit . The limitation could be breached in the case of the OPA , as in the case of the international regime , if âgross negligence and wilful misconduct of responsible partyâ is a   cause   of the incident . However , unlike the international regime , the limitation could also be breached if the incident is proximately caused by âthe violation of an applicable Federal safety , construction , or operating regulationâ by the responsible party ; or if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation or assistance in connection with the removal of activities or to comply with various orders .
 Standing to sue is based generally on proprietary right , or a legally protected right , and in the case of harm to a public facility , it is reserved to a governmental authority . A further common law   cause   of action is the public trust doctrine , which finds greater application in the United States . By virtue of that doctrine , the State holds title to certain natural resources in trust for the benefit of its citizens .
 As a member of the Special Committee , Fiji makes an important contribution to the work of the Committee and is a steadfast and respected voice in promoting the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples . Fiji 's principled support for the   cause   of decolonization is also made evident given the presence of its Minister for Foreign Affairs at this ceremony and by the fact that this is the second time in four years that Fiji hosts a Pacific regional seminar . I wish , therefore , on behalf of the members of the Committee , to reiterate our tribute to the Government and people of Fiji for their profound commitment to the cause of decolonization and , more generally , to the fundamental principles of justice , equal rights and self-determination of peoples which the United Nations has pledged to uphold .
 We are aware of the difficulties involved in your coming here and we appreciate the effort you have made and are looking forward to hearing your presentations regarding your Territories . And to all of those of you who are well known to us , we also express our appreciation and gratitude for the valuable information you bring to our Committee and for your perseverance and commitment to the   cause   of decolonization .

 He recalled the imperative need for developed countries to progressively eliminate all production and export support measures that annihilated LDCs ' efforts to participate in the international trading system , irrespective of the level of their comparative advantage in exporting given products . The representative of Oman , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said that the preliminary assessment of practical lessons drawn from a wide range of activities as reflected in the secretariat 's report -LRB- TD/B/50/3 -RRB- was   cause   for more optimism . She stressed the need for systematic exchange of information about progress in implementing the PoA at the national , regional and global levels .
 Nauru has licensed banks incorporated in Nauru that operate outside Nauru and are forbidden to operate in Nauru . Extensive secrecy provisions apply to their activities , subject to being over-ridden by Court order for   cause   - to date no such application has been made by any person or organisation . However their continued operation along with the continuation of the licensing of bank corporations is under review .
 Instead of cutting subsidies , both the EU and US reforms are seen merely as shifting subsidies into categories of subsidies -LRB- boxes -RRB- that are not subject to WTO reduction commitments . Blue box subsidies are only permitted under schemes which attempt to limit production -LRB- such as set-aside in the EU -RRB- and the green box subsidies are deemed not to distort trade or at most   cause   minimal distortion . The EU , however , has progressively been shifting amber box -LRB- AMS -RRB- subsidies into the blue box .
 Convinced that religious and cultural diversity in the globalizing world needs to be used as a vehicle for complementary creativity and dynamism and not as a rationale for a new ideological and political confrontation , Convinced also that defamation of religions , acts of prejudice , intolerance , discrimination , stereotyping , racial profiling in all forms , shapes and manifestations , misinterpreting religious teachings as advocacy of violence , desecrating religious sites and blaspheming revered religious personalities are an affront to human dignity and equality and   cause   discord and disharmony within and among societies , Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration , adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 2000 , welcoming the resolve expressed in the Declaration to take measures to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies , and looking forward to its effective implementation at all levels , including in the context of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted in September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance -LRB- A/CONF.189/12 -RRB- ,
 They know that the future of their nation , for generations to come , is at stake . Third , intensified efforts by Coalition forces to demonstrate that they are adhering strictly to international humanitarian law and human rights instruments â even in the face of deliberate and provocative terrorist attacks , sometimes against vulnerable and defenceless civilians â would make it that much more difficult for the insurgents to rally support for their   cause   . In this connection , the use of lethal force by the Coalition forces â in the context of military responses to threats to Coalition forces , dispersal of demonstrations , raids on homes and confrontations as well as at checkpoints â should , in accordance with international humanitarian law , be proportionate and discriminating .
 -LRB- iv -RRB- Report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination -LRB- A/58/16 , chapter III section B , programme 8 , chapter IV , section B -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB-   Causes   of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa : report of the Secretary-General -LRB- A/58/352 -RRB- The General Assembly decided to hear a statement by the observer of the Holy See in the debate on agenda item 39 .
 Those efforts , as well as compliance with the commitments entered into under the United Nations Programme of Action , will lead to a reduction in the amount of arms available to use by mercenaries . The recruitment , financing , training and use of mercenaries are a   cause   of concern to the international community because of their responsibility for violations of human rights and the provisions of international humanitarian law , and due to their links to the illicit trade in arms and diamonds and other criminal activities in which they are involved . Mexico is committed to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and has demonstrated its concern for that trade 's links with transnational organized crime , the illicit traffic of drugs and international terrorism , as well as its negative impact on democracy and the development of countries .
 The same must therefore be true , a fortiori , of the Guide to Practice . The explanatory phrase that introduces article 22 , paragraph 1 , may seem superfluous , but most members of the Commission take the view that this is not sufficient   cause   for modifying the wording chosen in 1969 and retained in 1986 . -LRB- 16 -RRB- This phrase , with its reference to treaty provisions , seems to suggest that model clauses should be included in the Guide to Practice .
 Risk and calamity management : In 1997 the Government of Haiti established the Civil Defence Department , whose role is to coordinate relief operations and activities to manage risks and calamities resulting from natural disasters . In 2000 , with UNDP support , the Department submitted a national risk and calamity management plan which has two main objectives : -LRB- 1 -RRB- to act on the   causes   and the factors creating the state of vulnerability in order to reduce the impact of calamities ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to strengthen the capacity to respond to needs in the case of calamities at all levels â central , departmental , commune and local . Decentralized civil defence committees have also been established .

 Observations and recommendations While many factors outside the control of the Organization will continue to influence the level of threats and risk to United Nations personnel , the fact that fatalities have decreased significantly over the past years gives   cause   for optimism that efforts under way to strengthen the United Nations security management system are on the right track . Continued emphasis on the implementation of the minimum operating security standards and an expansion of the scope of security and stress management training will serve to further reduce risks .
 There is no reason to think that such a new legal instrument would have a greater chance of being accepted than the 1980 Convention on Multimodal Transport . The major differences between legal cultures and mentalities already observed at the time , added to the irreconcilable interests of the various continents , are no   cause   for optimism . Furthermore , it would be foolish to extend to non-sea transport a new liability regime foreseen for sea transport which has yet failed to prove its worth for the very mode for which it appears to have been specifically designed , and whose chances of eliminating the chaos prevailing in sea transport already appear very thin , judging from the discussions held during previous sessions of UNCITRAL .
 And yet the work of the Commission over a period of 10 years shows how frequently judges and lawyers are exposed to risks that may range from harassment , intimidation or threats to assault , including physical violence and murder , to arbitrary arrest and detention , to restrictions on their freedom of movement , or to economic or other sanctions for measures they have taken in accordance with recognized professional obligations and standards and ethics . In the case of lawyers , it is not uncommon for such situations to result from the fact that Governments identify them with their clients '   cause   , particularly in politically sensitive cases . However , there can be no independence of judges and lawyers if those individuals can be exposed to such situations and if the State does not take steps to prevent and remedy them .
 Judges and lawyers are among the main defenders of human rights , and enjoyment of those rights by everyone is largely dependent on the proper administration of justice . The Special Rapporteur is persuaded that the institutional weaknesses and functional problems affecting the work of judges and lawyers are a direct   cause   of violations of the right to a fair trial . He therefore hopes to be able to develop fruitful cooperation with Governments both with reference to issues brought to their attention in urgent appeals and communications and in the course of in situ visits , and would note that all of these interactions should be perceived as tools for encouraging positive developments. It goes without saying that he is committed to making a balanced assessment of
 Because many persons with disabilities were farmers or people living in rural areas , their ability to feed themselves and their families was of key importance in rural settlements . FAO also stressed that malnourishment and undernourishment were important factors in the analysis of   causes   of disability , and of linkages between poverty and disability . The World Health Organization focused on physical , psychiatric , intellectual and sensory impairment when defining disability .
